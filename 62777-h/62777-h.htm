<div class="chapter">


<h2 class="nobreak">THE CROWN PRINCE OF REXANIA.</h2>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.</h3>

</div>

<p>Almost within a stone’s throw of the antique
structure that for a full century has
been known to New Yorkers as St. Mark’s
Church stands a mansion that has had, like
Eden, its glory and its fall. Once it was the
home of aristocracy and wealth. To-day it
is an eating-place for those whose lot is poverty
and whose faith is democratic.</p>

<p>At the moment at which our story opens,
the rooms in which in the old days portly
Knickerbockers indulged in stately feasts are
crowded with picturesque waifs from the Old
World, who have, for a variety of reasons,
crossed the Atlantic to air their woes in a
freer atmosphere than surrounded them at
home. A <i lang="fr">table-d’hôte</i> dinner, greasy, cheap,
and plentiful, is the magnet that has drawn
from the East Side many of its most daring
spirits, men with great grievances and enormous
appetites. While emphasizing the former
and appeasing the latter, these men grow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
loquacious and blow white clouds of cigarette
smoke toward the ceilings; and the dinner
nears its end.</p>

<p>It is with a group of four foreign malcontents
that we must seat ourselves in spirit,
for they have a mighty matter under discussion,
and in their conversation lies the explanation
of certain startling episodes that
occurred in the metropolis last year, the details
of which have not been made known
hitherto either to the public or to the police.</p>

<p>“You feel sure, Posadowski,” a frowzy-headed,
full-bearded man was saying in the
purest Rexanian, a dialect spoken by only a
few hundred East-siders, “you feel sure that
you have the dates exactly as they should be?”</p>

<p>“I will read you the letter, Rukacs, and
you can make your own calculations,” answered
Posadowski, a better-groomed man
than his companions, nearing middle age,
but with a fresh complexion and a clear, gray
eye that could look like ice or gleam with
fire, as the spirit of the man ordained. His
companions bent toward him eagerly, as he
took from his pocket a letter bearing a foreign
postmark. Lighting a fresh cigarette,
Posadowski read, in a low voice, the following
epistle:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>: Strange things have happened
in Rexania. The crown prince has
left here in disguise. Three men only know
this, the king, the prime minister, and myself.
If they knew that I held their secret,
this would be my last letter—eh, my friends?
But they will never suspect me—the best
servant in the palace—of communicating with
such rebellious rascals as you, Posadowski<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
and Rukacs and the rest of you. The king
was bitterly opposed to Prince Carlo’s journey.
But Carlo is no longer a boy. He is
a clever, active-minded, studious man, who
might have been one of us if he had not been
born a crown prince. He has great influence
over Prime Minister Fejeravy, and persuaded
him to plead with the king. Carlo has set
out for America, and travels incognito. I
have risked my life to tell you that he will
reach New York on the <i>Wiendam</i>, under the
title of Count Szalaki. He has promised to
return as soon as he has crossed the continent
and visited Chicago and San Francisco.
The fact is that the prince is anxious to see
for himself how a country looks that is governed
by its people. Poor fellow! I have
long felt sorry for him. Upon his firmness
at his father’s death will depend the maintenance
of the Rexanian monarchy, and I feel
sure that he is only half-hearted in his assumed
regard for royalty. But I dare not
waste more time on this hasty letter. I am
obliged to spend nearly all my time quieting
suspicions that I fear I may have aroused in
this palatial hotbed of treachery and intrigue.
Nevertheless, my brothers, reflect on this:
fate has placed a great opportunity in your
power. The king is old and failing. If the
crown prince is not at hand when the king
dies—well, there will be no more kings in
Rexania. The people love the prince; but if
he is not here when the sceptre falls from his
father’s hand he will never be crowned. It
is in your control—the future of Rexania. I
and my fellow-republicans—we are very
quiet at present—leave it to you to make
Rexania free. If the king dies and the crown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
prince is not here, no power on earth can prevent
the republic. My love and devotion to
you all. Courage! We trust to you.”</p>

</div>

<p>The faces of the conspirators had turned
pale as Posadowski had slowly and impressively
emphasized the pregnant sentences of
the revolutionist who defied death at the
king’s right hand.</p>

<p>“He is magnificent,” exclaimed Posnovitch,
the oldest member of the quartette, a
gigantic man, with picturesque gray locks.</p>

<p>“Yes. How little we have to fear, compared
with a spy who knows the king’s
secret thoughts and who lives under Fejeravy’s
eye,” remarked Rukacs. “But tell me,
Posadowski, have you a plan of action in
your mind?”</p>

<p>“There is only one thing to do,” said Ludovics,
a small, black-whiskered man with feverish
eyes and nervous manner. “Count—Count
Szalaki, I think, was the name he
took, was it not?—must not leave this country
alive.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” whispered Posadowski, imperatively,
as a waiter refilled their coffee-cups.
“You were always reckless, Ludovics.
There may be a way open to us that does not
require bloodshed. The crown prince, we
are told, is not a monarchist at heart.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be deceived by that fact—if it is a
fact,” returned Ludovics, hotly. “He won’t
abdicate. Whatever may be his inner convictions,
he has an hereditary liking for a
throne, and I’m sure that his visit to this
country will destroy all fondness that he may
have begotten, in his imagination, for republics.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>His companions looked at the speaker suspiciously.
Was he growing reactionary in
his views? was the question that came into
their minds.</p>

<p>“Don’t mistake me,” he continued, noting
their look of consternation. “I am as good
a republican as walks the earth, but I don’t
think a surface view of this country will have
an influence upon the crown prince tending
toward a great renunciation on his part. He
will return to Rexania more determined than
he is at present to rule. I tell you, my brothers,
the prince must be destroyed, if he won’t
be converted.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a time. Finally,
Posnovitch beckoned to a waiter and ordered
brandy for the quartette.</p>

<p>“Posadowski, what do you propose?” asked
Rukacs, smiling as he glanced confidingly at
the real leader of the group.</p>

<p>The clear-eyed Rexanian gazed thoughtfully
at his companions. “Our steps must
be guided by circumstances,” he remarked,
guardedly. “The <i>Wiendam</i> is due here on
the 7th. It is now the 5th. One of us must
make it his duty to shadow the prince and
keep informed of his every movement.”</p>

<p>“You’re the man to do it, Posadowski,” exclaimed
Posnovitch, with conviction. “You
have become more Americanized than the
rest of us, and won’t create suspicion. Will
you accept the responsibility?”</p>

<p>Posadowski sat silent for a time, puffing
cigarette smoke thoughtfully and looking at
his companions, who were watching him
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right, Posnovitch. I see
no reason why I should not take the prince<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
in tow. But let me impress several things
upon you all. Listen. We must arrange a
plan whereby I can summon you here at an
hour’s notice. I have in mind a scheme that
will require firmness on our part, but is not
attended with any great danger. Not that
any of you fear that. We all got used to it
in the revolutionary days, ten years ago.
Rexania was not a bed of roses at that time,
was it, Rukacs? But to the point. That
brandy has made me sentimental, and I’m
tempted to dwell on the past rather than the
future. Now, my brothers, if you really
wish to leave this matter to me for the time
being, I will do my best to satisfy you all.
Our aim is simply this: to keep the crown
prince in this country—which means, of
course, within our immediate vicinity—until
the king dies. An interregnum of even one
day would be fatal to monarchy in Rexania.
To-morrow night I will tell you all the details
of my plan. Meanwhile, let us be seen
together as little as possible. Posnovitch,
come to me in the morning. I have a journey
that I want you to make into Westchester
County. And be careful of the brandy
to-night. You must have a clear head to-morrow
to carry out your part of the plan.
Do you understand me?”</p>

<p>“Well enough to keep sober,” answered the
elderly giant, good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“And so good-night, my brothers,” said
Posadowski, as he arose to leave the room.
To each of them he gave his hand, and before
he turned to go bent down to them and
in solemn tones cried, feelingly, “God bless
Rexania and make her free!”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.</h3>

</div>

<p>“I consider him,” said Mrs. Strong, wife
of Gerald Strong the banker, “I consider
him, Kate, the handsomest and most attractive
man I have ever met. Everybody on
the steamer was charmed with him. Even
your father, who is not impressionable, was
fascinated by Count Szalaki.”</p>

<p>“His name sounds like the toothache,” remarked
Kate Strong, gazing at her mother
with an unbending countenance. They were
seated in the drawing-room of one of the
most luxurious homes in upper Fifth Avenue,
half an hour before the time set for dinner.</p>

<p>Kate Strong resembled her mother in face
and figure. They were tall, graceful women,
with clear-cut, patrician features. The
difference in their ages was not strongly
marked. Mrs. Strong often remarked playfully
that she and her daughter had grown up
together. But, while Mrs. Strong’s hair had
begun to turn white beneath the touch of advancing
years, the golden glory of youth still
rested upon Kate’s head. Furthermore, there
was a great contrast in the habitual expression
that animated their respective faces.
There were firm, almost harsh, lines around
Mrs. Strong’s mouth that told of a strong
will and indicated a set purpose in life.
Kate’s face, beautiful in contour and dazzling
in the freshness of its tints, betrayed a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
rebellious, restless nature that had not yet
found in existence an ambition that fully satisfied
her soul. The mother’s lips seemed
fashioned for command, the daughter’s for
something they had not yet tasted.</p>

<p>“You are so flippant, Kate,” remarked Mrs.
Strong, reprovingly. “I am sure that when
you see the count you will not feel inclined
to joke about anything connected with him—not
even his name.”</p>

<p>“He seems to have hypnotized you, mamma.
Tell me about him. Is he very high
in rank?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Strong smiled at her daughter’s show
of interest. It pleased her.</p>

<p>“We really don’t know, Kate, just how
prominent he is in Rexania. It’s a queer
country, you know. They’re always having
outbreaks there, and the kings and nobles
have to go armed most of the time. But
your father says that the count, although he
is very reticent about his country and its
affairs, seems to be on intimate terms with
all the crowned heads of Europe.”</p>

<p>At this moment, Ned Strong, a youth a
few years older than Kate, entered the room,
carefully attired in evening dress.</p>

<p>“I suppose, mamma, that your friend the
count will be late. It’s a way those foreigners
have. There’s no snap about them: is
there, Kate?”</p>

<p>The girl looked up admiringly at her tall,
handsome brother, whose manly, vibrant
voice indicated an energetic temperament
that possessed large dynamic possibilities
for good or evil.</p>

<p>“That’s the reason I like them,” she exclaimed,
inconsistently. “They don’t seem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
to feel that they were put into the world to
do something. They are clever. They made
their ancestors do their work.”</p>

<p>Ned Strong glanced at his mother quizzically.</p>

<p>“I wish,” he said earnestly, “that we could
get Kate to have a few firm convictions.
What she is in favor of one day she is sure
to be opposed to the next. It is so hard to
tell what she really thinks.”</p>

<p>Kate smiled amusedly. “Forgive me,
Ned,” she implored. “I’m sorry I don’t
please you. But I’ll make you a promise.
If you are really anxious to know what I
think of Count Szalaki, I’ll tell you to-night
after he has gone. But here’s papa. He
knows more about Count Szalaki than mamma
does.”</p>

<p>“Yes, father,” put in Ned, rising as Gerald
Strong, a portly, clean-shaven, gray-haired
man, entered the drawing-room. “Tell us
about the count. Is there anything to him
besides his title?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Ned, I think there is,” answered
Mr. Strong, seating himself and looking at
his watch. “He’s got manners and good
looks, speaks several languages, and seems
to have read a good deal. But he’s awfully
green about this country. He really seemed
to think that Chicago was more of a place
than New York. He’ll get over that, of
course. I wanted to have him meet some of
our people to-night, but he begged me to
receive him <i lang="fr">en famille</i>. He seems to dread
notoriety.”</p>

<p>“That looks suspicious,” commented Kate.</p>

<p>“I am astonished, Kate,” exclaimed Mrs.
Strong. “One would think that you could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
not trust your father and myself to travel
alone for fear that we should be imposed
upon. Count Szalaki wants to see the country,
not to be interviewed by reporters.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” remarked Ned, looking at
his father, “are there many Rexanians in
New York?”</p>

<p>“A few hundred, I believe, on the East
Side,” answered Mr. Strong, who had taken
a practical interest in politics during the revival
of reform movements. “Most of them
came over here about ten years ago, when
the present king banished a large number of
revolutionists. I have heard that they make
good citizens, but are inclined to talk anarchy
when under the influence of beer.”</p>

<p>“Did you talk politics with the count?”</p>

<p>“I tried to,” answered Mr. Strong, again
glancing at his watch, for he was sorely in
need of a dinner. “He is a very sensible
young man, considering the fact that he has
a title and estates in a monarchical country.
But he got more out of me than I obtained
from him. He asked me a hundred questions—some
of them really laughable—about our
form of government and my opinion of the
ability of a free people to rule themselves.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” remarked Ned, sarcastically,
“you gave him to understand that we place
entire confidence in the ‘people,’ <i>hoi polloi</i>,
<i>demos</i>. You said nothing to him about
‘bosses’?”</p>

<p>Mr. Strong glanced at his son deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“Satire is not your strong point, Ned.
Of course I didn’t dwell upon the defects
of our system to the count. I rather encouraged
him to think that our experiment in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
self-government had been a thorough success.”</p>

<p>“It certainly has, father—for the bankers,”
commented the young man, gazing quizzically
at Mr. Strong.</p>

<p>“Isn’t Ned unbearable!” cried Kate, warmly.
“Perhaps, Ned, you’ll be willing to tell
the count just how this country ought to be
governed.”</p>

<p>“I leave that to you, Kate. Don’t you attend
Professor Smith’s lectures on representative
government? Surely the count can
learn more about our institutions from the
women of our set than from the men.”</p>

<p>“We have more patriotism,” cried Kate.</p>

<p>“No, you have more leisure,” answered
Ned.</p>

<p>“Be quiet, children,” whispered Mrs.
Strong, nervously, as the butler appeared
at the door and announced:</p>

<p>“Count Szalaki.”</p>

<p>A young man entered the drawing-room
hastily, and bent courteously over Mrs.
Strong’s outstretched hand.</p>

<p>“He looks like Lord Byron,” whispered
Kate to her brother. Then she turned and
met the smiling eyes of a youth whose glance
was strangely magnetic.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.</h3>

</div>

<p>“You have never been in Europe, then,
Miss Strong?”</p>

<p>Count Szalaki turned smilingly to his <i lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i>
as they seated themselves at the dining-table
in a room that appeared luxurious even
to the eye of the guest. There was a peculiarity
in his pronunciation that defies reproduction
in cold type. His voice was gentle
and carefully modulated, and the English
language seemed to do homage to his rank,
for it fell from his lips in a musical softness
that was extremely pleasing to the ear.</p>

<p>Kate Strong was fascinated, against her
will, by the dark gray eyes of the picturesque
youth at her side. His black hair curled
romantically about a high, white brow, and
his mouth, symmetrically curved, indicated
an imaginative and generous temperament.
His white, even teeth added vastly to the
brilliancy of his smile. There was a touch
of embarrassment in his manner, now and
then, that seemed to exact sympathy from
his entertainers.</p>

<p>“Not since I was quite young,” answered
Kate, with the air of one who has reached
extreme old age.</p>

<p>“My sister,” remarked Ned Strong, as the
butler removed his soup-plate—“my sister,
Count Szalaki, is a tremendous democrat,
you know. She won’t go to Europe, I fear,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
until every country over there has become
a republic.”</p>

<p>“How unfair!” cried Mrs. Strong, glancing
deprecatingly at her son.</p>

<p>“Then, Miss Strong, you don’t approve of
foreign aristocrats?” asked the count gently,
smiling at Kate in a confiding way.</p>

<p>“Indeed I do,” she returned, looking defiantly
at Ned. “We should be very dull in
our set, you know, without them.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t take them <i lang="fr">au sérieux</i>?” asked
the count, anxious to stand on solid ground.</p>

<p>“Indeed we don’t,” cried Kate. “We
marry them, you know.”</p>

<p>Count Szalaki looked at his host in a puzzled
way, and Mr. Strong smiled benignantly.</p>

<p>“I think I told you on the steamer, count,”
remarked Mr. Strong, “that you would find
it easier to understand our political institutions
than our American girl, did I not?”</p>

<p>Count Szalaki looked at Kate, an expression
of admiration in his eyes that savored
not at all of boldness. “I think,” he said,
“that I shall take your politics for granted
and attempt the solution of the greater puzzle.”</p>

<p>“Take my advice and don’t do it, Count
Szalaki,” cried Ned. “Our politics are laughable,
but our American girl is—is——”</p>

<p>“Is what, Ned?” asked Kate, with mock
cordiality.</p>

<p>“Is dangerous,” answered her brother.
“You see, count, you come here several
years too late. When I was young,” he continued,
smilingly, “that is, about two years
ago, we were not under the depressing influence
of the New Woman. But now it is
different. The New Woman——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>Count Szalaki’s mobile face bore an expression
of bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” he exclaimed. “I am what
you call—puzzled. I have not heard that
expression heretofore. What do you mean
by the New Woman?”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak, Ned,” cried Kate, imploringly.
“Let me tell Count Szalaki what the
New Woman is.”</p>

<p>“That is better, Ned,” remarked Mr.
Strong, diplomatically. “It would be unfair
for the count to get your definition first.”</p>

<p>“I really think,” put in Mrs. Strong, anxiety
in her voice, “that we ought to change
the subject.”</p>

<p>Count Szalaki glanced at her with a mournful
smile on his lips and a pleading glance in
his eloquent eyes.</p>

<p>“But, Mrs. Strong, you must take pity on
me. Remember, I am only a barbarian. In
my country, you know, we go very slowly.
We cling to old forms, old customs, old ideas.
That is why I came over here. I wished to
broaden my mind and to keep in touch with
the progress of the age.”</p>

<p>“Then there are no advanced women in
Rexania?” asked Ned, courteously.</p>

<p>Count Szalaki seemed to wince as the
name of his fatherland was brought into the
discussion. Kate afterward said that he actually
turned pale.</p>

<p>“I can hardly say that,” answered their
guest, rather sadly, as it seemed. “There
are women there who are discontented with
our institutions, who are desirous of changes
in all directions. I was only a boy at the
time of the great outbreak in my country,
ten years ago, but I remember that among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
the rioters were many women. One woman
led a party of malcontents who attacked the
palace. The guards were preparing to shoot
her, when I saw what they were about to do
and ordered them to lower their guns. Five
years later, I was thrown from my horse
while hunting in a forest, not far from Rexopolis,
and broke my arm. I was carried
to a hut in the woods, and an elderly woman
very gently cared for me until help arrived
from the palace. Before they took me away,
she confided to me that she was the rebel who
had led the attack on the palace and whose
life I had saved. She became a loyal subject
from the moment I gave the order that saved
her life. She is now in the employ of the
king, and is doing good service in keeping
him informed of the doings of those who plot
against the throne.”</p>

<p>An expression of surprise had crossed the
faces of the diners at their guest’s tale.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” remarked Ned, as the count
ceased to speak, “but do you live in the palace
at Rexopolis?”</p>

<p>If Count Szalaki felt any annoyance at his
own loquacity he controlled it successfully.
The influence of his surroundings had made
him quite forget, for the time being, that he
was hiding behind an incognito, and that ordinary
prudence demanded that he should
keep his secret. With a strong effort, he
succeeded in suppressing all signs of dismay
at his unguarded recklessness. His life had
tended to make him diplomatic, but his nature
was frank and confiding, and he was
very sensitive to his environment. “Surely,”
he thought, “these hospitable, kindly, democratic
people are not of a suspicious character.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
The thought reassured him, and he
said:</p>

<p>“I have a relative near the throne, you
know. I sometimes spend several weeks
with him at the palace.”</p>

<p>“Then you know the king?” cried Kate,
interestedly. “I have read so much about
him. And the crown prince? Is he as handsome
as the newspapers say he is?”</p>

<p>It was an embarrassing question, and the
prince drank a half-glass of champagne before
answering his fair <i lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i>.</p>

<p>“I may be prejudiced in his favor,” he said,
at length, “but he is young and in good
health, and, I think, pleasing to the eye.”
Then he added, hurriedly, “But I am here
to learn all about this country, not to talk
about my own. Tell me, is Chicago far from
New York?”</p>

<p>The conversation gradually drifted into
safer channels, and Count Szalaki had begun
to feel that his indiscretion had given him
the only nervous shock that he would experience
during the evening, when the butler approached
the guest’s chair and said, apologetically:</p>

<p>“Pardon me, monsieur, but this note has
just been presented at the door by a man
who says that it must reach you at once.”</p>

<p>Count Szalaki’s face flushed and then
turned very pale. His hand trembled slightly
as he took the envelope from the outstretched
tray. It bore the name he had
chosen for his incognito, and in the corner
were written, in the Rexanian dialect, the
words “Important and immediate.”</p>

<p>“Will you forgive me,” said the count,
glancing at Mrs. Strong, “if I open this at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
once? There seems to be some mystery
about it.”</p>

<p>His hostess smiled and bowed, and the
youth opened the missive and read the following
startling sentences, written, like the
words on the envelope, in the purest Rexanian:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Your Royal Highness</span>,—A great danger
threatens you. But trust to us. We are
your friends. Dismiss your carriage on
leaving the house, and walk down the avenue.
Two men will join you who love you
and your house. We are under oath to guard
you from harm, and take this way to warn
you. In the name of Rexania, be prudent.”</p>

</div>

<p>The letter was unsigned, and an expression
of consternation and perplexity rested
on the prince’s face as he reread the note and
then carefully inserted it in a pocket of his
waistcoat.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.</h3>

</div>

<p>By a strong effort of will, the prince controlled
his agitation, and, eying the butler
keenly, asked:</p>

<p>“Is the man who brought this note awaiting
an answer?”</p>

<p>“No, monsieur. He went away at once.”</p>

<p>“Very good!” exclaimed the Rexanian.
Then, as if coming suddenly to a determination,
he continued, “Will you kindly dismiss
my carriage? I will walk back to my
hotel.”</p>

<p>After Mrs. Strong and Kate had left the
men to their <i lang="fr">liqueurs</i> and cigars, Count Szalaki,
as we shall continue to call him, turned to
his host and asked:</p>

<p>“Are there many of my countrymen in
New York, Mr. Strong?”</p>

<p>“I was telling my son about them before
you arrived,” answered Mr. Strong, whose
curiosity was greatly excited by the episode
that had just occurred. “There are a few
hundred Rexanians on the East Side. By
the way, I forgot to remind you, Ned, that
our man Rudolph is from Rexopolis. It
slipped my mind at the moment. You see,
count, I have dabbled a little in politics.
After an election a few years ago, a Rexanian
who had made some political speeches
for us on the East Side applied to me for
work. It happened that I wanted a man to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
live in the lodge of our old homestead up in
Westchester, and I gave Rudolph the place.”</p>

<p>“He has served you well?” asked Count
Szalaki, whose manner still gave slight evidences
of suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>“He has been very faithful. He drinks a
little too much brandy now and then, I believe,
but he is well fitted for his not very
onerous duties. You see, our old homestead—I
was born there, as my grandfather and
father were before me—has been allowed to
fall into disuse. My family have always preferred
Newport to Westchester in summer,
and I have never had the heart to sell the
place. Rudolph’s duty is to take care of the
house and grounds, and mine to resist all
temptation to sell them.”</p>

<p>“I am glad,” remarked Count Szalaki,
courteously, “that one of my people has
been of service to you. But tell me about
these few hundred Rexanians on the East
Side. Are they quiet, reputable citizens?
Do they give you any trouble?”</p>

<p>“They are considered, I believe,” answered
Mr. Strong, carefully weighing his words,
“very industrious and law-abiding men;
rather clannish, but great enthusiasts regarding
our form of government.”</p>

<p>Count Szalaki sipped his Chartreuse meditatively.
He had a decision to make that
seemed to him to be of great moment. He
was placed in a very awkward position. The
fact that there were men in the city who
knew his name and his rank had come to
him as a stunning blow. It had been a great
relief to him to get away from Rexopolis, a
hotbed of intrigue and peril, and to find himself
in a great city in which, as he had fondly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
believed, he could come and go without a
thought of danger or the necessity of using
any especial precautions. And now in the
twinkling of an eye he had been confronted
by a mystery and a menace. He felt a curious
sensation of utter helplessness, a desire
for advice, and the certainty that there was
no one who could give it to him. Young
though he was, he was a man of great physical
and moral courage, but he was also a
youth of strong imaginative powers, and the
position in which he was now placed appeared
to his overwrought mind to be filled
with lurking perils against which he could
think of no way to protect himself. Then
his mind dwelt upon the kind and loyal
words of the note that he had just received,
and he felt impelled to put his trust in those
who had sent it to him. The people of Rexania
had always been fond of the crown
prince: when he had appeared to the crowds
in Rexopolis the cheers had ever been heartfelt
and inspiring, and the youth felt sure
that the mass of his people loved him. But
there were schemers and rebels among them,
as he well knew, and the feeling had been
upon him for years that at any moment he
might meet with a violent death. It was to
get a few months’ relief from this oppressive
sensation that he had come to the New World.
It was, therefore, a bitter disappointment to
find that even in the land of universal freedom
the heir to a throne may be shadowed
by those who know his secret and who may
or may not desire his destruction.</p>

<p>If Count Szalaki had been a man of wider
experience, if he had realized that conditions
prevailing in Rexopolis were impossible in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
New York, he would have taken steps at this
crisis that would have solved his difficulties
at little or no risk to himself. A frank statement
of the whole affair to Gerald Strong
would have placed the Rexanian prince in
perfect touch with his novel environment.
It would have enabled him to remove the
annoyances that threatened him as easily as
the wind puts a fog to flight. But he kept
his secret to himself, and thus made his first
great blunder in a series of missteps that were
followed by consequences affecting a vast
multitude in Europe and a good many people
on this side of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>As they rejoined Mrs. Strong and her
daughter in the drawing-room, the Rexanian
made a great effort to throw off the depression
that had affected his spirits while he
puffed his cigar.</p>

<p>“You look more cheerful, Count Szalaki,”
remarked Kate, sympathetically. “I hope
you have received no bad news?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” he answered, with forced gayety.
“A friend is awaiting me outside to
walk to my hotel with me; and I fear that he
is a bore.”</p>

<p>“How very sad!” commented Kate, while the
feeling crept over her that here was a man who
had about him a great mystery. It was the
one thing lacking to make him irresistibly fascinating
to a girl who was surfeited with men
about whom there was nothing new to learn.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” went on the Rexanian, brushing
the dark locks back from his forehead with
a white, tapering hand, “perhaps you will
take pity on me, Miss Strong, and give me
courage for my walk to-night by the prospect
of a stroll with you to-morrow afternoon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>He was not quite sure that, even in the land
of liberty, this proposition would be considered
good form, but his mood had grown
somewhat reckless under the pressure of
events.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” answered Kate, frankly. “It
will give me great pleasure to show you
something of our city. I shall expect you
about three o’clock.” She held out her hand
to him as he arose to make his adieux.</p>

<p>Ned Strong had succumbed, as had his
parents and sister, to the magnetism of their
guest.</p>

<p>“I should be pleased to look you up to-morrow
morning, Count Szalaki,” he said
cordially. “If you are fond of driving, I’ll
stop at the hotel with my cart before noon.”</p>

<p>“That is very charming,” cried the Rexanian.
“You have all been so kind to me.
I cannot find terms in which to express my
gratitude.” The hand-clasp he gave his host
and hostess proved the sincerity of his words.</p>

<p>He was gone, and Ned Strong stood looking
at his sister.</p>

<p>“You promised me, Kate,” he said playfully,
“that you would tell me what you
thought of him. Now is the appointed time.”</p>

<p>“I think,” answered Kate, slowly, “I think,
Ned, that Count Szalaki is a delightful man—who
is in very great trouble.”</p>

<p>“Kate is right, Gerald,” commented Mrs.
Strong, looking at her husband. “What do
you suppose that note said?”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine,” answered Gerald Strong,
musingly. “I shall cable our agent at Vienna
in the morning to go to Rexopolis and
find out who Count Szalaki is.”</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.</h3>

</div>

<p>At seven o’clock that evening Posadowski
and Posnovitch had entered an elevated car
at Houston Street, bound up-town. They
were dressed with more regard for appearances
than usual. On their faces was an expression
of suppressed excitement, and their
gestures, as they talked earnestly in their
native tongue, indicated that they had a
grave matter under discussion.</p>

<p>“I will tell you all that I have done,” said
Posadowski, after they were seated. “Part
of it you know. You have fixed Rudolph,
and the house is ready for us. Did he give
you much trouble?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Posnovitch. “Give Rudolph
plenty of liquor, a little money, and
appeal to his patriotism, and he is an easy
tool to handle.”</p>

<p>“Good!” returned Posadowski. “Now I
have sworn in fifteen men who have agreed
to devote their time for the next few weeks
to this matter. Eight of them went up to
Rudolph’s place at six o’clock. At four
o’clock to-morrow morning they will be relieved
by the others. I have arranged the
shifts so that the work will be easy for all of
us.”</p>

<p>“But how,” asked Posnovitch, eagerly,
“will you get the prince to leave the house
alone?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>“I know the man,” answered Posadowski.
“I am depending upon his pride and the fact
that he will not dare to make a confidant of
any one of his new friends.”</p>

<p>“How did you learn where he was going to
dine?”</p>

<p>“That was not difficult,” answered Posadowski
modestly. “I heard him tell the
clerk at his hotel this afternoon to send any
cable despatch that came for him this evening
to No.—Fifth Avenue. I telegraphed
Rukacs, in cipher, to watch the house and to
have the carriage ready for us. Svolak—I
swore him in this morning—will be on the
box alone. There is only one thing now that
can defeat our scheme.”</p>

<p>“And that is——?” asked the gigantic
Rexanian, eagerly.</p>

<p>“The refusal of the prince to look upon us
as friends.”</p>

<p>“He will be suspicious, of course. And
we can’t use violence on Fifth Avenue in the
early evening.”</p>

<p>Posadowski smiled confidently. Taking a
letter from his pocket, he handed it to his
companion. It was a short note, addressed
to “My Good Friend Posadowski,” signed by
the King of Rexania, and expressing the
gratitude of the writer for services performed
by the recipient.</p>

<p>“It is easily explained,” remarked the arch-conspirator.
“My brother, you know, was a
loyalist. He did the king many good turns
in the days of the revolution. When my
brother died, his effects were sent to me; I
found this letter among them. The Rexanian
officials on the border are sometimes very
careless. Of course I have always taken good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
care of this epistle. I had a feeling that it
would be of value to me some time or other.
I am inclined to think that the success of our
plans to-night rests on the king’s signature.”</p>

<p>“You heard from the palace to-day?”</p>

<p>“A short cable despatch in cipher. The
king is restless; his physicians are worried
about him.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Posnovitch. “I think they
have good cause to be. Both he and his
kingdom are on their last legs.”</p>

<p>When the train reached Forty-seventh
Street the two Rexanians made a hasty exit
and hurried down the stairs. It was a hot,
close night in September. Somehow the
summer, dissatisfied with its career, had
impinged upon the fall and was now engaged
in maliciously breaking a record.
The sky was overhung with heavy clouds,
and now and then a flash of lightning glared
through the streets.</p>

<p>Posadowski and his towering companion
turned up Fifth Avenue, and after a short
walk were accosted by Rukacs. Pointing to
a house just opposite to where they stood,
he said, with a tremor of excitement in his
voice:</p>

<p>“There’s where he is dining. He has been
in there over an hour.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Posadowski. “Wait here
until I rejoin you.”</p>

<p>Crossing the street, the Rexanian mounted
the steps of Gerald Strong’s mansion, rang
the bell, and, after a short discussion with
the attendant, left in his hands the note that
informed the prince that friends awaited him
outside—a note that, as we know, he received
and acted upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>When he returned to the sidewalk, Posadowski,
noting carefully that he was not
being watched from the house, approached
the carriage that was awaiting the prince’s
exit.</p>

<p>“Listen, Svolak,” he said to the liveried
driver, who had dismounted from the box.
“If you are dismissed by an order from the
house, drive off and station yourself by that
corner light, half a block down the street.
Wait there until you get another order from
me. Understand me?”</p>

<p>“Thoroughly,” answered Svolak, remounting
the box.</p>

<p>A moment later Posadowski had rejoined
Posnovitch and Rukacs on the opposite side
of the street. The front door of the house
opened; the hall attendant ran down the
steps and gave an order to Svolak. The carriage
rattled over the noisy pavement and
made its way down-town.</p>

<p>“All goes well, my brothers,” cried Posadowski,
joyfully. “If he leaves that house
alone, no power on earth can save the kingdom
of Rexania from destruction. Never
before in the history of the world did the
birth of a republic depend upon whether a
guest left his host in company or alone. But
that is just how the crisis stands at this moment.
I have played the whole game on the
chance that the prince will not care to have
his new friends learn his secret. I believe
that he will come out to us alone. If he
does, success is in our hands. If he doesn’t,
we must wait for another chance.”</p>

<p>Time went by: the conspirators grew restless
and impatient. So much was at stake
on the opening of the front door of a Fifth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
Avenue mansion that they were appalled by
the possibilities suggested by the line of
thought Posadowski had struck out. It was
not too much to say that peace or war in
Europe might depend upon the details of the
next exit that should take place through the
entrance that glared at them across the street.</p>

<p>Suddenly Posadowski clutched Rukacs’
arm. “Here he comes,” he whispered.
“Walk down toward the carriage. I will
join him at once. Let me do the talking.
You can put in a word of loyalty at first, but
keep quiet after that. Go!”</p>

<p>On the steps opposite to them stood the
prince, gazing up and down the street, as
the door closed behind him. There for a
moment he paused, the incarnation of an
anachronism, a youth who had failed to conceal
his awful crime of being born a king.
For that one moment he stood, poised on the
brink of a precipice, while Reaction and
Progress trembled in the balance. Then
slowly he descended the steps and found
himself face to face with Posadowski. As
he scanned his fellow-countryman searchingly,
the Crown Prince of Rexania felt reassured.</p>

<p>“Let us walk down the avenue together,”
said Posadowski, quietly, purposely avoiding
the young man’s title. “I have much to say
to you, and friends await us down the street.”</p>

<p>For one moment the prince hesitated: his
eyes sought the house he had just left, as
though the mansion contained something
from which he had no wish to part. Then
he turned and accompanied Posadowski down
the avenue.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.</h3>

</div>

<p>“These men are your friends and know
your secret,” whispered Posadowski to the
prince, as they approached Rukacs and Posnovitch,
who were standing boldly in the
glare of an electric light by the side of the
carriage.</p>

<p>He who called himself Count Szalaki was
somewhat paler than usual, but his step was
firm, and there was that in his bearing that
caused a pang of regret in the mind of his
companion. It takes a very hardened conspirator
to cast youth into captivity without
a touch of remorse.</p>

<p>“Rukacs, Posnovitch,” said Posadowski, in
a low tone, as the quartette formed by the
sidewalk’s edge, “you know who this man
is. What is our duty toward him.”</p>

<p>“To protect him and defend him with our
life-blood, when the need shall come,” answered
Rukacs and Posnovitch in concert.</p>

<p>Count Szalaki’s dark eyes glowed with the
effort he was making to search the souls of
the men around him.</p>

<p>“What do you wish from me?” he asked
haughtily, withdrawing himself from too
close contact with his companions.</p>

<p>“We have no time to lose, your—your
majesty,” whispered Posadowski, impressively.
“It is growing late. If you doubt our
sincerity, a short drive will take us to my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
rooms. We have in our possession letters
and diagrams taken—to be frank with you—from
certain of our countrymen living in this
city. These documents will prove to you
that a plan has been perfected that puts your
life in peril.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not bring the papers with
you?” asked the prince suspiciously.</p>

<p>“It would have been a reckless thing to
do,” answered the gigantic Posnovitch.</p>

<p>Posadowski put up his hand deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“Allow me to explain,” he said, in a firm
voice. “We dare not let this evidence leave
our hands. It would cost us our lives if your
enemies found that we had betrayed them.
And they are very keen-witted. They have
placed you under surveillance at your hotel:
if you examined these documents at your
rooms they would know of it, and our efforts
to protect you would be vain.”</p>

<p>Count Szalaki’s face wore an expression of
bewilderment and uncertainty. He was frank
and unsuspicious by nature, but the atmosphere
of a court had done much to destroy
that confidence in his fellow-man that pertained
to his temperament and his years.
The men surrounding him impressed him favorably.
They seemed to him to belong to
that class of Rexanians—merchants and men
of affairs who desired no change in the government—who
had always been in Rexopolis
the firmest friends of his house. But he hesitated
to put himself in their power. In a
strange land, surrounded by customs and
conditions with which he was unfamiliar, he
began to feel that he might be in even
greater peril than that which surrounded
him at all times in the palace at Rexopolis.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
It was simply a choice between two evils
that confronted him, and he had about decided
to defy the danger which, he had been
told, menaced him from a general conspiracy,
rather than place himself in a closed
carriage with the bewhiskered men at his
side, when Posadowski, observing the prince’s
indecision, said:</p>

<p>“It is not surprising, your royal highness,
that you find yourself in a quandary. We
say that we are your friends. That is no
proof that we tell the truth. But time is
precious. We can wait no longer. I will
convince you on the instant that you can
trust us.”</p>

<p>The arch-conspirator drew a letter from a
pocket in his coat.</p>

<p>“One moment,” he said, moving nearer to
the light, with the letter in his hand. “Is
there anything familiar to you in my face?”</p>

<p>The youth from whose grasp a throne was
slipping glanced keenly at Posadowski’s
countenance.</p>

<p>“Truly,” he said, “I seem to have seen
your face before. Your name is——?”</p>

<p>“Posadowski,” answered the Rexanian.</p>

<p>A puzzled expression crossed the prince’s
face. “I thought,” he said musingly, “that
Posadowski died.”</p>

<p>“I did not die,” cried the other. “I left
Rexania and came to this city. Time presses.
Here is a letter to me from your father. It
will prove to you that I have always been,
as I am to-night, loyal to you and to your
house.”</p>

<p>The prince seized the letter that Posadowski
had read to Posnovitch in the elevated
train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>“It is enough,” he exclaimed, smiling cordially
as he returned the epistle to Posadowski.
“I believe that you are my friends. If
you play me false, great will be your punishment.
If you are true—and I think you are—your
reward shall be worthy of my father.
Come! Let us go.”</p>

<p>With a countenance that showed intense
relief and a light heart that beat with pleasure
at the sight in that distant land of his father’s
signature, the prince entered the carriage.
He was followed by Posnovitch and
Posadowski, who took the seat opposite to
the crown prince. Rukacs mounted the box
beside Svolak. The latter, turning his horses
around, hit them a clip with the whip, and
the vehicle bounded at a rapid rate up the
avenue.</p>

<p>There was silence inside for a time. Finally
the prince, taking out his cigar-case,
offered it to the men in front of him. Posadowski
refused to smoke, but Posnovitch and
the prince at once began to fill the vehicle
with the fumes of tobacco. The latter felt
the need of something to quiet his overwrought
nerves. He found himself in a
curious state of mind. Fully did he realize
that it was incumbent upon him to keep his
attention fixed upon his companions and his
surroundings, for the position in which he
was placed had revived the suspicions that
had beset him before he had read his father’s
note. But, try as he might, his will refused
to direct the current of his thoughts. He
found himself dwelling with strange pleasure
on the events of the evening. The face of
Kate Strong, with its clear-cut features, brilliant
eyes, and a golden glory of waving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
hair, smiled at him in the darkness and made
him impatient of the night. He had come
to America to study politics; he found his
whole heart and mind engrossed with a girl
he had seen but once, and whom the conditions
of his birth placed as far out of his
reach as if he had been born an African
slave. The prerogatives of royalty seemed
to him at that moment to be worthless. That
he must wed for policy, not for love, he well
knew, and a spirit of rebellion against the
hard fate that had made him a crown prince
arose in his soul. He puffed his cigar nervously
as the thought forced itself upon him
that, while a duke might marry an American
girl, a king could not. His romantic face
grew melancholy as his revery became more
sombre. The air was oppressive, and distant
thunder added to the dismal influences
surrounding him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the prince aroused himself. Pulling
out his watch, he saw that the hour was
late. The carriage at that moment was crossing
a long bridge, and the youth caught the
gleam of lightning as it was reflected from
the water beneath them. His forebodings
instantly reawakened. The carriage had left
the bridge behind it, as the prince placed his
hand on the knob of the door and said sternly
to the silent conspirators before him:</p>

<p>“Stop the carriage. I wish to talk to you
before we go farther.”</p>

<p>A revolver in the firm grasp of Posadowski
gleamed, as the lightning flashed again, and
the prince heard a harsh voice say to him:</p>

<p>“Be quiet! Make another motion, and
there will be one king less in the world.
Do you understand—now?”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.</h3>

</div>

<p>Surrounded by trees and haughtily succumbing
to decay, an ancient mansion, colonial
in style, stands half-way between the
shore of Long Island Sound and the old post-road
to Boston, not many miles from Harlem
Bridge. On the most brilliant day it is a
gloomy, ghostly-looking structure, and the
weed-choked grounds surrounding the house
add to the unattractiveness of a spot that was
once pleasing to the eye and noted for the
elegance of the hospitality dispensed by those
who made the old brick homestead a cheery
place to visit. The house is built on a generous
plan. A wide piazza, supporting white
Corinthian columns, faces the lawn. At the
back of the house, jutting out from the second
story, is a large balcony commanding a
magnificent view of the Sound. Inside the
structure wide halls, enormous drawing-rooms,
a stately dining-apartment, and, upstairs,
a labyrinth of airy sleeping-rooms,
prove that their former occupants were fond
of luxury. The furniture has fallen to
pieces, the hangings are worn and dusty, and
the partially dismantled house seems to
breathe a protest in every nook and corner
against the negligence that has allowed its
former glories to lose their lustre beneath
the iconoclastic hand of time.</p>

<p>It was an especially dreary place at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
moment at which it demands our attention.
Surrounded by a high wall, nothing can be
seen of the house from the main road but its
sloping roof and the gable windows beneath
it. At the side of the large gateway that
makes an entrance for the carriage-path leading
up to the mansion is a small cottage that
serves as a modest lodging for the Rexanian,
Rudolph Smolenski, in whose charge
the Strongs’ homestead had been placed
some years previous to the opening of this
story.</p>

<p>It is one o’clock in the morning. The day
has made a tempestuous entrance. Lightning
flashes across the waters of the Sound,
and deep peals of thunder make the ground
tremble with their force. The rain, after
long delay, has come at last, and beats down
upon the mansion and the lodge as though
it would wash them clean of all relics of the
past. It leaks through cracks that time has
made, and adds to the moist discomfort of
rooms that are never wholly dry. But there
are unwonted signs of cheer in the mansion
and at the lodge. There are gleams of moving
lights that meet the storm as it beats
against the shuttered windows of the old
house, and a steady ray defeats the darkness
in front of the decaying lodge.</p>

<p>Let us enter the smaller structure first.
Two men are seated at a table in the front
room on the ground floor. An oil lamp dimly
illuminates the barely furnished apartment
and casts weird shadows across the uncarpeted
floor. One of these men we have met
before. It is the impetuous little Ludovics,
whose patriotism is as indiscreet as it is enthusiastic.
His bright beady eyes gleam in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
the half light: his thin face is flushed, partially
from excitement, but in a larger degree
from the brandy he has drunk.</p>

<p>His companion is Rudolph, the lodge-keeper,
a flabby-faced, thickset man, with
heavy features and the look of one who enjoys
soft places and hard liquor. They are
bending forward, listening.</p>

<p>“It’s queer they don’t come,” Rudolph remarked,
musingly. “I hear no sound of
wheels. Here, man, have another drop to
keep you awake.” He filled Ludovics’ glass
from the bottle, and then replenished his
own. Rudolph drank like one who needs
renewed vigor, Ludovics like a man trying to
quench the fires of impatience.</p>

<p>“I hope,” said the latter, looking searchingly
at Rudolph, “that they haven’t got too
much of this stuff up at the house.”</p>

<p>“Only one bottle, this size,” answered Rudolph,
fingering the bottle lovingly. “One
quart won’t do much harm among five men.
And they’ll need it, I tell you. That old
house takes water like a sponge on a night
like this. I’ve done what I could to make it
comfortable for you all, but I wasn’t prepared
for a flood like this.”</p>

<p>“Hark,” cried Ludovics nervously, turning
an ear to the window: “I thought I heard
wheels.”</p>

<p>“They’re in your head, Ludovics,” remarked
Rudolph, jocosely. He had picked
up a good deal of slang from the Westchester
urchins who haunted the lodge gate. “Come,
light a cigar. In a storm like this it’s a hard
drive after they leave the bridge. I don’t
expect them for an hour yet.”</p>

<p>They puffed in silence for a time. Finally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
Ludovics said, with suppressed excitement
in his voice:</p>

<p>“Rudolph, you’re a man of sense, and you
love the cause. Do you realize the full significance
of this night’s work?”</p>

<p>The lodge-keeper turned his puffy, pallid
face full toward his guest and eyed him
keenly.</p>

<p>“No, Ludovics; and nobody does. It’ll
probably cost me my job.”</p>

<p>Ludovics waved his hand impatiently.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean that. If we are cautious, I
don’t see how you can get into trouble.
What I mean is this: we are to have the
whole political future of our fatherland, the
fate of dear old Rexania, right here in our
grasp. No power on earth can despoil us of
our absolute grip upon a nation’s destiny so
long as the crown prince is within our control.
It is an awful responsibility that comes
to us to-night, Rudolph.”</p>

<p>The speaker glanced searchingly at his
companion. He would have given a great
deal to know how much of an impression he
was making on the phlegmatic Rexanian,
who continued to drink brandy without growing
one whit more demonstrative. Finally
Rudolph said, as a tremendous crash of thunder
died away in bounding echoes across the
Sound:</p>

<p>“What are you driving at, Ludovics? Can’t
you leave the brunt of the business to Posadowski?”</p>

<p>The excitable little Rexanian controlled
his agitation with an effort. “He’s so damned
conservative, Rudolph!” he cried. “I believe
he thinks he can persuade Prince Carlo to
abdicate, even if the king does not die while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
his heir-apparent is cooped up here.” Then
he jumped from his chair and strode nervously
up and down the room. “It’s all nonsense!
Trying to compromise with a monarchy
is like giving your wife your purse:
you get the leather back and she keeps the
money. Rudolph,”—and here the little man
stood still and glanced piercingly at his companion—“no
monarchy in Europe can be
turned into a republic unless somebody,
somewhere, uses heroic measures.”</p>

<p>The lodge-keeper smiled cautiously.</p>

<p>“Don’t you call kidnapping a traveller in
this part of the world using heroic measures?”</p>

<p>Ludovics flushed angrily. “Only fools,”
he cried, “use heroic measures that are not
quite heroic enough. Don’t be stupid, Rudolph.
You understand me. Pish! how I
hate half-baked patriots! We’d have won
our fight ten years ago, if we hadn’t had
among us men who didn’t dare take advantage
of the power they had grasped. The
Rexanian republic must never be lost again
because we revolutionists aren’t equal to the
crisis that confronts us. Do you think,” he
cried, again standing in front of Rudolph and
gesticulating wildly, “do you think I care for
my liberty or my life if I can do something
that will give my country freedom? I hate
all kings, Rudolph. Who dare say to me
that a king deserves mercy at my hands?
Did not a king kill my father and banish me
from the land of my birth? Did not a king
seize my patrimony and leave me a pauper,
an outcast, a man without a country and
without a hope? Mercy? I would sooner
give meat to a dog that bit my shins than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
grant life to a king whose breast was at my
dagger’s end. Do you know me now, Rudolph?
Do you read my heart? I tell you,
man, the night outside is not blacker than
my soul when I think of kings. Kings!
Kings! They say God made them! Then,
by God, the devil shall destroy them. Give
me more brandy, Rudolph. The storm is
working in my blood! Ha, but that was a
glorious flash! The sky’s own fireworks
light the coming of our prince to our little
dove-cot.”</p>

<p>A wild crash of thunder seemed to applaud
the madman’s words.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet,” cried Rudolph, jumping up
and placing his fat, yellowish hand on Ludovics’
arm. “I hear the sound of wheels.
Yes, yes, man, I am right. They are here.”</p>

<p>A carriage stopped outside, and a blow
that echoed through the cottage fell on the
iron gate that blocked the roadway.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

</div>

<p>“Go back to the city at once, and report
here to-morrow afternoon at four o’clock,”
said Posadowski to Svolak, the gate having
been opened by Rudolph and the carriage
drawn up in front of the lodge.</p>

<p>The arch-conspirator had left Posnovitch
to guard the crown prince inside the vehicle.</p>

<p>“Who is with you?” he asked hastily of
Rudolph, as he placed his hand on the handle
of the carriage door.</p>

<p>“Ludovics,” whispered the lodge-keeper,
very softly. “Look out for him. He is
drunk and desperate.”</p>

<p>A few moments later the four Rexanians—Posadowski,
Posnovitch, Rudolph, and Ludovics—surrounded
Prince Carlo in the parlor
of the lodge. The prince’s face was pale,
but his mouth bore a determined expression
and his gleaming eyes did not flinch as he
gazed searchingly at his captors in the dim
light of the inhospitable apartment.</p>

<p>“I repeat, your royal highness,” said Posadowski,
impressively, “that you are among
friends or enemies as you choose to make us.
We are your friends if you will conform
readily to our wishes. We are your enemies
if you offer resistance.”</p>

<p>“Milk and water,” muttered Ludovics sullenly.
Posadowski glanced angrily at the
overwrought revolutionist, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“I am to understand,” remarked the prince,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
haughtily, “that I am your prisoner, and that
I can obtain my freedom only under certain
conditions.”</p>

<p>“Precisely,” answered Posadowski. “Those
conditions we will outline to you to-morrow.
Rudolph, is his highness’ apartment ready
for him?”</p>

<p>“Yes; we will go up to the house at once,
if you wish.” The lodge-keeper walked to a
window and looked out into the night. “The
rain has ceased,” he said. Approaching
Prince Carlo, he asked, with marked deference,
“May I offer you some brandy? You
have had a hard ride, your highness.”</p>

<p>The prince hesitated. He felt cold, and a
depression of spirits that had not affected
him in the carriage overcame him at this
moment. Courteous as these men were to
him, he realized that they were determined
and dangerous characters, the ringleaders in
a revolt that, ten years before, had made
them exiles. That they would take every
advantage of the opportunity that chance
and his own short-sightedness had thrown
in their way he well knew. But of all the
dismal influences that surrounded him there
was none that affected him so unpleasantly as
little Ludovics’ gaze. He could not escape it.
Whichever way he turned his face, he realized
that the piercing eyes of the undersized
Rexanian were upon him, pitiless, revengeful,
unflinching. Meeting Ludovics’ glance as
Rudolph held out to him a glass half-full of
brandy, a chill more penetrating than any he
had ever felt struck to the prince’s marrow,
and he drained the liquor eagerly. His hand
trembled slightly as he returned the glass to
Rudolph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>“Before we leave this place,” said Posadowski,
drawing nearer to his captive and
speaking sternly, “you must understand that
you are absolutely powerless. The guard
around you night and day will render escape
impossible. The house to which we go at
once has long been deserted, and none but
a few tradesmen ever visit this lodge. An
exile in Siberia is no farther removed from
outside aid than are you, Prince Carlo of
Rexania. But do not imagine for an instant
that your life is in the slightest danger. You
are surrounded by your own countrymen, by
those who admire you personally, while they
detest the institutions you represent—institutions
that, I can well imagine, a man of
your age and intelligence cannot, in his heart
of hearts, uphold.”</p>

<p>The pale cheeks of the captive prince
turned red at these words. He drew himself
up arrogantly, and the spirit of a regal ancestry
gleamed in his dark eyes as they
rested defiantly upon the first man who had
ever dared to question his loyalty to monarchy.</p>

<p>“Have done!” he cried, imperiously.
“Powerless though I may be, there are
words on your lips that I must refuse to hear.”</p>

<p>“Coward! coward!” shrieked Ludovics.
“A king is always a coward! You’re afraid
of the truth! Coward! Coward!”</p>

<p>The gigantic Posnovitch placed his hand
over the dwarfish drunkard’s mouth.</p>

<p>“Put him to bed, and keep him there, Posnovitch,”
cried Posadowski savagely. “If
he makes any noise thrash him. Come, Rudolph,
we will conduct Prince Carlo to his
room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>Ludovics glared madly at Posadowski.
Twisting, with an agility begotten by alcoholic
stimulants, out of the grasp of Posnovitch,
he made a dash for the table, and,
seizing the brandy bottle, would have dashed
it against the head of the crown prince if
Rudolph had not stayed his murderous hand
at the last moment.</p>

<p>“We leave him to you,” said the lodge-keeper,
stolidly, as he placed the struggling
Ludovics in the grip of Posnovitch again.
“Don’t let him play you the same trick
twice.”</p>

<p>With Posadowski on one side of him and
Rudolph on the other side, Prince Carlo left
the lodge and turned his weary steps toward
the gloomy house at the end of the driveway.
The rain no longer fell, but the night
was black and oppressive, and now and again
the lightning gleamed fitfully across the distant
waters of the sound. There was no invigoration
in the atmosphere. The storm
had left in its trail a moisture that seemed
to take uncanny pleasure in emphasizing the
heat. But, in spite of all this, Prince Carlo
felt again that grewsome sensation of cold
that had affected his nerves in the rooms
they had just left. As the trio mounted the
broad steps that led to the piazza, beneath
which gloomy shadows lurked, this feeling
of chilliness increased, and it was only by a
strong effort of will that he saved himself
from trembling beneath the grasp of his conductors.</p>

<p>Three men met them at the main entrance.
“Silence!” cried Posadowski to the Rexanians
in the hall-way. “Two of you remain
here. We will go upstairs at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>One of the conspirators stalked up the
broad staircase in front of the prince and his
companions. A lamp gleamed dimly at the
landing, and, grasping it as he turned into
the upper hall-way, their conductor led them
through a doorway into a large, gloomy
sleeping-room at the rear of the house. The
apartment exhibited signs of long disuse,
disguised in part by a hasty attempt to make
it inhabitable. The old-fashioned bed was
made up with linen furnished by the lodge-keeper.
The faded hangings in front of the
windows had been pulled back to conceal
their tattered condition, and, had it not been
for the damp and heavy atmosphere of the
room, it would have presented many welcome
features to a very weary man.</p>

<p>“Here we leave you, Prince Carlo,” remarked
Posadowski, in a low voice. “If our
hospitality is lacking in luxuries, believe me,
it is not our fault. I assure you it is my sincere
hope that you will rest well; for there
are weighty matters to be decided between
us to-morrow. Good-night, your royal highness;
good-night.”</p>

<p>Prince Carlo bent his head slightly in recognition
of the arch-conspirator’s last words,
and on the instant found himself alone. The
sound of a closing door and of a key turned
in the old-fashioned lock echoed drearily
through the house as the prince stepped hurriedly
to one of the windows and attempted
to raise it to air the room. The window was
locked. What it meant to be a prisoner
broke darkly upon the young man’s mind,
and he threw himself in despair upon the
bed and moaned in utter misery.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.</h3>

</div>

<p>On the second morning after the crown
prince’s abduction, Gerald Strong and his
family formed themselves at breakfast into
what Ned called “a committee of the whole
on the Szalaki matter.”</p>

<p>“I received a cable despatch late yesterday
afternoon, dated at Rexopolis, and signed by
our Vienna agent,” remarked Strong the
elder, glancing rather shamefacedly at Kate.
“It ran as follows: ‘Szalaki common name.
No nobility.’ I begin to fear that your
mother and I were too easily affected by
pleasing manners and a handsome face.”</p>

<p>“The thing looks queer,” exclaimed Ned,
emphatically. “When I drove up to the
hotel yesterday before noon a curious feeling
came over me that I would not find the
count. When I asked for him at the desk, a
peculiar expression rested on the clerk’s
face, and he looked at me suspiciously.
When I had given him my name, he seemed
to feel more confidence in me, for he told me
that Count Szalaki had not returned to the
hotel the night before. About an hour before
I reached there yesterday morning a man had
given the clerk a note from Count Szalaki,
enclosing the amount of his bill and directing
the hotel people to put all his belongings
in the care of the bearer. The man looked
like a foreigner. The clerk carefully compared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
the count’s signature on the note with
his name on the hotel register, and became
satisfied that they were penned by the same
hand. There was nothing for him to do, of
course, but to obey the orders contained in
the note. I tell you, father, it looks queer.”</p>

<p>Kate Strong had said nothing after seating
herself at the table, but her face showed that
she was intensely interested in the conversation
going on between her father and her
brother. Her cheeks were paler than usual,
and dark shadows rested beneath her eyes.
She ate nothing, and sipped her coffee languidly.
Ned’s emphatic insistence on the
“queerness” of the whole affair seemed to
annoy her, for she exclaimed, a slight tinge
of red appearing in her face:</p>

<p>“I don’t believe, Ned, that Count Szalaki
is a fraud. It’s strange, of course, that he
sent me no word of apology for not keeping
his engagement; but, somehow, I feel sure
that there is an adequate explanation for his
silence.”</p>

<p>“But you forget your father’s cable despatch,
Kate,” remarked Mrs. Strong, coldly.
She suffered intensely at the idea that her
boasted knowledge of human nature had
been insufficient to protect the family from
an impostor.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” exclaimed Gerald Strong,
rather testily, as he motioned to the butler
to hand him a morning newspaper, “no great
harm is done even if Count Szalaki is not
what he appeared to be. If he is an adventurer,
we certainly got off very cheaply.”</p>

<p>Kate Strong did not wholly agree with her
father in this conclusion. She was dissatisfied
with herself, and weary for the moment, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
her environment. Whatever Count Szalaki
might be—confidence man, rolling stone,
conspirator, or what not—she felt that he
had played a more important <i lang="fr">rôle</i> in her eyes
than either he or her family realized. How
could Count Szalaki or her people know that
this self-contained, worldly-wise, seemingly
unimpressionable New York girl, who had
been flattered and petted and obeyed since
her nursery days, had found in the Rexanian
the incarnation of her secret dreams of romance?
How could they realize that the
very mystery that placed him beyond the
pale of Gerald Strong’s consideration had
but added to the fascination that his memory
exerted over the girl? Kate was not by temperament
a sickly sentimental woman, but
she was not yet too old or world-worn to
dream wild, sweet dreams, and to long for
the day when out of the shadowland of commonplace
would come a royal youth who
would lead her up to the sun-kissed palace
of love and mystery that crowns the distant
mountain-top. She had seen Count Szalaki
but once, but in the beauty of his face and
the soft, almost caressing accent of his voice
she had found reason for the hope that her
dreams might not be mockeries, that in the
land of reality there might be a prince who,
kissing the lips of the sleeping maiden, would
awaken her to a life that should satisfy the
longings of her weary soul. All this she
hardly dared to admit to herself, but she was
honest enough in her self-communion to acknowledge
that Count Szalaki appealed to
her imagination as no man heretofore had
touched it. It hurt her pride to feel that her
parents and brother had relegated this visitor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
from her land of dreams to the limbo in which
honest people placed impostors. As she
mused silently on the accusing fact that had
been brought to her notice regarding the
youth who fulfilled in so many details her
ideal, an exclamation of surprise from her
father aroused her from her revery.</p>

<p>“Here’s a long despatch in the <cite>Trumpet</cite>
from Rexopolis,” exclaimed Gerald Strong,
glancing at his son. “Listen. ‘There is
much suppressed excitement in this city.
The guards at the palace have been doubled,
and rumor has it that King Sergius III. is
dangerously ill. Premier Fejeravy was seen
by your correspondent to-day, but refused to
admit or deny the truth of the report. One
of the astonishing features of the situation
lies in the fact that the Crown Prince
Carlo has not appeared in public for some
time past. It has been his custom heretofore
to show himself to the people whenever
his aged father was indisposed. This has
been good policy on his part, as he is very
popular, and there is always talk of a revolutionary
outbreak here when the king is
threatened with death. The maintenance of
the monarchy, if King Sergius should die,
rests entirely on the popularity of Prince
Carlo, as the undercurrent of feeling in favor
of a republic is very strong. It is suspected
that France and Russia would not be opposed
to the overthrow of the reigning house and
the formation of a Rexanian republic. There
are many reasons why a buffer republic at
this point would be of advantage to the
Franco-Russian coalition. The Rexanian
army has been greatly strengthened of late
years, but its loyalty to the crown is under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
suspicion. There is little doubt that a large
number of the rank and file, and a few of the
officers, are under the influence of republican
ideas. Under these conditions, every scrap
of news from the palace is eagerly awaited
by the crowd in the streets. It is rumored
at this writing that a famous specialist from
Paris has just reached the city and is being
hurried to the king’s bedside. Business is
practically at a standstill, and any moment
may give birth to events in this city that
will affect the whole of Europe.’”</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. At
length Ned remarked:</p>

<p>“I can’t make anything out of it, father.
I am free to admit that Count Szalaki impressed
me as a thorough gentleman, too
young and unsophisticated to be a dangerous
schemer. But he comes to us, and while
here receives a note that affects him strangely.
Then he disappears, leaving no word of
apology or explanation behind him. And
now we learn that his country is on the eve
of startling events. He told us that he came
here to study our institutions. By Jove, I
have it, father! He is a revolutionist, and
the crisis at Rexopolis has called him back
at once. I’ll bet a penny that he sailed for
Europe yesterday morning!”</p>

<p>Gerald Strong rose, and remarked, indifferently:</p>

<p>“Well, well, Ned, you may be right. I
should prefer to learn that he was a rebel
and not a rascal. He was a charming boy.
But I doubt if we ever hear of him again.
You don’t look well, Kate. You must get
more exercise.”</p>

<p>“I’m going up to the Country Club to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
with Ned,” said Kate, smiling at her
father as she left the table. “We will take
a spin on our wheels and be back here for a
late dinner. Isn’t that our plan, Ned?”</p>

<p>“I believe it is,” answered her brother.
“And to-day I shall try to find out what has
become of Count Szalaki.”</p>

<p>The young man did not know that the expression
on his sister’s face was one of mingled
gratitude and hope, born of the words he
had just spoken.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.</h3>

</div>

<p>The sun had peeped above the island to
the eastward and was throwing its caressing
rays across the Sound. The storm that had
chastised the waters and grumbled its way
inland had left a smiling daybreak in its
track. The Crown Prince of Rexania still
tossed in feverish sleep upon his bed upstairs
as Posadowski and Posnovitch, who had obtained
a short but thorough rest, stood behind
the old manor house, looking out upon
the golden shimmer that gilded the tossing
waters of the Sound.</p>

<p>“There is only one way to deal with Ludovics,”
said Posadowski, emphatically. “There
is a great risk in sending him back to the
city, but I dare not keep him here. He’s a
murderous little man when in liquor, and our
force is not large enough to keep a close
watch upon him. Now, my plan is this.
When the prince awakens, I will persuade
him to write a note giving you authority to
get his belongings at the hotel. He wouldn’t
be thoroughly comfortable here in evening
dress. I will also put Ludovics in your
charge. You must take him to the city and
on your way down intimate that if he returns
here he will be locked up, and if he
plays us false in the city there are fourteen
men each one of whom will swear to have
his life. Do you understand me, Posnovitch?
Good! Go and call him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>A few moments later Ludovics, pale and
limp, felt the cool, morning air kissing his
fevered cheeks. He stood before Posadowski
trembling, repentant, and not quite clear
in his mind. He vaguely realized that he
had done something mutinous, but just what
it was he could not remember.</p>

<p>“Ludovics,” said Posadowski, sternly, “for
the sake of the cause you love, it is best that
you should accompany Posnovitch to the
city. Don’t return here until you get an
order from me. Understand?”</p>

<p>The small man trembled with nervousness,
and his eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>“Forgive me,” he whispered. “I forget
what I did that annoyed you. I will hereafter
do as you wish. Come, Posnovitch,”
he continued, meekly, “I am ready to go
with you.”</p>

<p>“There is no hurry,” remarked Posadowski,
more gently than he had spoken before.
“Posnovitch will have to wait here until I
get a note for him from the crown prince.”</p>

<p>Ludovics’ eyes gleamed as the name of
the man he had attempted to brain with a
bottle reached his ear. He gazed about him
restlessly for a moment, and then said, earnestly:</p>

<p>“Yes, Posadowski, you are right. It is
better that I should go back to New York.”</p>

<p>At three o’clock in the afternoon of this
day, the city editor of the <cite>Trumpet</cite> sent for a
reporter named Norman Benedict, a discreet
but energetic and ambitious youth, whose
record in the office was high.</p>

<p>“Benedict,” said the editor, “I want you to
read this cable despatch. I will give you
your orders afterward.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>He handed the reporter a proof of the despatch
from Rexopolis that Gerald Strong on
the following morning was to read to his
family at the breakfast table.</p>

<p>“You can keep the proof for reference,”
said the city editor, as the young man
glanced up from the despatch. “Now, I
want you to get among the Rexanians on the
East Side and interview those who are willing
to talk. They may be close-mouthed,
but they are a thirsty crowd, and by spending
a little money on them you will be able
to set their tongues a-wagging. Get your
copy in early. I want to make as good a
showing as possible on the city end of this
Rexanian business.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Norman Benedict was
puffing a cigarette in the restaurant near St.
Mark’s Church, in which the reader first made
the acquaintance of the Rexanian conspirators.
It was not yet four o’clock, and the
café was well-nigh deserted. In one corner
of the room, however, sat Ludovics, sipping
brandy and smoking cigars. He felt lonely,
and an indistinct impression was upon him
that somebody, somehow, had done him a
great wrong. He had depended upon liquor
to clear his brain and to restore him to a
thorough comprehension of what had befallen
him, but his constitution was not equal
to a full reaction, and the more brandy he
drank the more acute became his sense of
wrong and his certainty as to the source and
character of the injustice that had been done
him. There were two ideas in his mind to
which he clung tenaciously, and which, by
persistent nourishing, had become to his distorted
consciousness facts of great moment:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
he had been ill-treated by a king, and that
king was entertaining a few favored guests,
with wild revelry, somewhere up in Westchester
County.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said Benedict, who suspected
that Ludovics was a Rexanian, partially
because of his presence in the restaurant,
but in a larger degree on account of the
little man’s peculiar cast of countenance—“pardon
me, but can you tell me where I
can find somebody who is well acquainted
with the city of Rexopolis?”</p>

<p>The reporter had crossed the café and
seated himself at the table at which Ludovics
preserved his wrongs in brandy. The
disgraced conspirator glared at the youth
suspiciously. Benedict’s frank, smiling face
disarmed distrust.</p>

<p>“Before you answer,” went on the reporter,
“permit me to order some fresh cigars,
and—and—you are drinking?”</p>

<p>“Brandy,” answered Ludovics, gratefully,
for his supply of cash was beginning to get
low.</p>

<p>“Very good!” cried Benedict. “Waiter,
bring out a pint of your choicest cognac and
half a dozen of your very best cigars.”</p>

<p>Ludovics smiled cordially. He liked this
open-handed youth.</p>

<p>“You are from Rexania?” asked Benedict,
as he lighted a cigar and gazed earnestly at
Ludovics’ flushed face.</p>

<p>“Rexania!” cried the latter, hysterically.
“Rexania! Of course I’m from Rexania.
And, let me tell you, young man, I’m going
back to Rexania. Did you say the king
wouldn’t let me? You lie, young man, you
lie! He can’t help it. How can a dead king<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
keep a live man out of his fatherland? Tell
me that, will you?”</p>

<p>Ludovics paused and glanced around the
deserted room suspiciously. Then he again
turned his eyes to the sympathetic face of
his companion. He vaguely felt that he
should stop sipping liquor and keep his reckless
tongue quiet, but he was in a mood that
craved expression, and Benedict’s cordial
manner was very soothing to the overwrought
Rexanian. The reporter had been
successful in his profession from his power
of allaying suspicion and inspiring confidence.</p>

<p>“But, my friend,” suggested Benedict,
quietly, “the king is not yet dead—though
very ill.”</p>

<p>Ludovics looked almost sober as he flashed
an eager and inquiring glance at the young
man.</p>

<p>“How do you know that? Have you heard
from Rexopolis?”</p>

<p>Benedict did not reply for a moment. He
was carefully weighing a bold step. Should
he show this man the proof of the cable despatch
he carried with him? “He will be
too drunk in an hour to sell the news to another
paper, even if he knew the ropes well
enough when sober,” reflected Benedict, as
he took the proof-slip from his coat and
handed it to Ludovics.</p>

<p>The effect of the despatch on the Rexanian
astonished the reporter. The little man uttered
a shout of triumph and then glanced
anxiously around the room. Seizing his
brandy-glass, he drained it to the bottom.
Such glimmerings of common sense as had
marked his conversation up to this point deserted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
him on the instant. His disordered
mind fell back upon the idea that he had been
wronged by a king, and that that king was
holding high carnival up in Westchester
County.</p>

<p>“Young man,” he said, impressively, a
wild gleam in his restless eyes, “I don’t
know who you are, but I’d trust you with
my life. Listen!” He leaned forward across
the table and placed a clammy hand on Benedict’s
arm. “Listen! I’ve been drinking too
much: haven’t I? Don’t lie to me. I can
see it in your face. I’m drunk, and you
show it. That’s queer, isn’t it? But I could
tell you something that would make you
drunk and me sober. I’ll try it. Bend
nearer to me. They don’t know in Rexania
where the crown prince is. The king is
dying. Damn him! let him die. Look
here, boy, I’d kill all kings! Wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p>The intoxicated Rexanian gazed suspiciously
at Benedict.</p>

<p>“Of course I would,” answered the reporter,
heartily. A conviction had come
upon him that the little drunkard had something
in his mind that was not altogether an
alcoholic hallucination.</p>

<p>“I knew you would,” cried Ludovics, in
delight. “You’re not made of dough, like—like—well,
never mind their names. But
look here, boy, I need your help. There’s a
king up in Westchester—do you hear me—who
tried to take my life.”</p>

<p>Benedict began to fear that he had been
wasting time and money to no purpose on
this madcap foreigner, when the latter noting,
with drunken slyness, the change of expression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
on the youth’s face, felt that his
pride had been hurt.</p>

<p>“You doubt my word, boy,” he cried, angrily.
“I don’t know who you are, or what
you mean by trying to find out what I mean.
But I’m telling you the truth. We’ve got
the Crown Prince of Rexania up in Westchester,
and—and——” A look of horror crossed
Ludovics’ face as he realized what he had
done. He trembled violently, and the tears
poured down his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Let me have some more brandy,” he implored,
in a weak voice, but before the waiter
could get it for him he had fallen forward
on to the table and into a deep stupor.</p>

<p>Norman Benedict arose, and, giving the
waiter a bill, directed him to see to it that
the Rexanian was cared for until the next
day, when he would look in upon him. Then
he hastily left the restaurant and strode eagerly
away. Whether he had received a
newspaper “tip” of great value or only the
dregs of a drunkard’s mind he was not sure.
But there had been something in the words
and manner of the brandy-soaked Rexanian
that strongly impressed Benedict with the
idea that he could not afford wholly to neglect
the hint that had been thrown out. The
despatch from Rexopolis said that the crown
prince had not been seen for weeks. Benedict
turned cold at the tremendous possibilities
suggested by the thoughts that
crowded through his brain.</p>

<p>“I’ll abandon the interviews and run my
risk,” he finally decided. “My first step is
to find out if there are any Rexanians living
in Westchester County. That ought to be
easy. I’ll try the office first.”</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.</h3>

</div>

<p>At the moment at which Norman Benedict
had come to the decision recorded at the
close of the preceding chapter, a ceremony
unprecedented in the history of the New
World had reached a crisis in Westchester
County. Rudolph, the lodge-keeper, who
was more thoroughly Americanized than his
fellow-Rexanians—perhaps because of his
long association with the stray urchins who
haunted the lodge gate—had characterized
this function to his fellow-conspirators as the
“putting of a disorderly king through the
third degree.”</p>

<p>Rudolph’s phrase, however, was not quite
accurate, for Prince Carlo of Rexania, far
from being disorderly, had become convinced,
after thoroughly investigating his
environment and weighing the possibility of
escape, that his only hope lay in a diplomatic
concession, for the time being, to his captors’
wishes. It was not lack of courage and
daring that had caused him to reach this conclusion.
He possessed not only a bold heart
but a clear head. But he fully realized that
at the present stage of the game his opponents
held all the trumps. Examining his
belongings, after his luggage had reached his
room, he found that all his money had been
taken from him. Even the loose change that
he had carried with him on the night of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
capture had been removed from his pockets
while he slept.</p>

<p>Just how far he had been carried from New
York he did not know. He realized clearly
enough, however, that, without money and
unacquainted with the customs of the country,
he would be in a most embarrassing position
even if he could elude his vigilant
guards and escape to the city. He had sworn
to his father to preserve his incognito, and
to keep from Rexanian consular and diplomatic
agents the knowledge of his absence
from his native land. Prince Carlo was at
heart a loyal reactionist, and, having pledged
his royal word to his royal father, it never occurred
to him that circumstances might arise
that would make the breaking of his promise
justifiable. He possessed a kingly regard for
truth that was absurdly quixotic, and which
hampered him in dealing with men who had
had considerable experience in American
politics.</p>

<p>Shortly after three o’clock on the afternoon
that found Ludovics too loquacious and a
newspaper reporter quite worthy of his
profession, the balcony jutting out from
Prince Carlo’s sleeping apartments and
overlooking the Sound served as a stage
for a one-act melodrama that might find
its place, perhaps as a curtain-raiser to a
tragedy.</p>

<p>Kings there have been who sought the
New World as an asylum from the dangers
that surrounded them at home. Crowned
heads in Europe have bowed in sorrow over
events that have taken place on this side of
the Atlantic. Wherever monarchs rule, the
very name of America sends a shudder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
through the palace that shakes the throne
itself. But never before, in the strange,
weird history of human progress, had a captive
king gazed at the blue waters of Long
Island Sound and listened to the burning
words of those who denied his divine right
to rule.</p>

<p>“It is well,” said Posadowski, glancing
kindly at Prince Carlo, who was seated in
an old-fashioned easy-chair, around which
the arch-conspirator and his colleagues, Posnovitch,
Rukacs, and Rudolph, had grouped
themselves, “it is well that we should come
to an understanding as quickly as possible.
And, before we go a step farther, let me reiterate
and emphasize what I have told you
once before, that there is not one of us here
who does not feel kindly toward you as a
man. We are determined that no harm shall
befall your person. But we are bound, also,
by another oath. You must know by this
time what it is. We have sworn that you,
Prince Carlo, shall never mount the throne
of Rexania.”</p>

<p>The youth, whose clear-cut face was pale
and drawn, gazed musingly at the blue waters
that grew gloriously cerulean as the autumnal
sun crept westward. Brushing the
black curling locks back from his troubled
brow, he seemed to invoke the God of his
fathers to give him strength in his hour of
trial.</p>

<p>“What would you have me do?” he asked,
firmly. “State clearly your wishes.”</p>

<p>Posadowski’s face was almost benignant,
as his eyes rested sorrowfully on the disturbed
countenance of the prince.</p>

<p>“I regret to tell you, Prince Carlo, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
your father is very dangerously ill,” said the
arch-conspirator, gently.</p>

<p>The young man sprang up from his seat in
dismay.</p>

<p>“My God!” he cried, “can you find the
heart to lie to me at such a time as this?
My father, the king, is not ill. You are deceiving
me, for some purpose I cannot
grasp.”</p>

<p>Posadowski drew himself up to his full
height and gazed at the prince with wounded
dignity.</p>

<p>“I do not lie to you, Prince Carlo,” he said
firmly, in a low voice. “I received a cable
despatch in cipher direct from the palace
this morning.”</p>

<p>Prince Carlo had sunk back into his chair,
and was glancing feverishly from one Rexanian
to another, seemingly in the hope that
one of them would come to his aid and give
the lie to Posadowski. But there was that
in the faces and manner of the men surrounding
him that slowly but surely impressed
him with the conviction that he was
not again a victim of subterfuge—that what
Posadowski had told him was indeed the
truth.</p>

<p>The youth’s hand trembled and his cheeks
burned as he felt the tears welling from his
eyes. Recovering himself instantly, he gazed
earnestly at Posadowski, as though he would
read the man’s very soul.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me that you are in
communication with the palace at Rexopolis?”</p>

<p>“I am,” answered the arch-conspirator,
simply. “I have been for some years
past.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>The prince forgot for a moment that he
was anything but a son, soon to be fatherless,
a son who had not been too loyal or
obedient at the end.</p>

<p>“Tell me—tell me,” he implored, “is there
no hope? Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“There is no hope, Prince Carlo, unless a
famous specialist from Paris can perform a
miracle. To-morrow I shall know what this
man has done for the king.”</p>

<p>A sob broke from the overburdened heart
of the youth, and tears of honest sympathy
filled the eyes of his countrymen. Suddenly
Prince Carlo sprang up, his face ghastly in
its pallor and his eyes aglow with the fervor
of his hope.</p>

<p>“You will let me go to him? My countrymen,
for the love of God, for the love
you bore your fathers, let me go to him! I
must—I must see him before he dies.”</p>

<p>Posadowski’s lips trembled and his voice
faltered, as he said, “We cannot let you go,
Prince Carlo unless—unless——” His voice
failed him.</p>

<p>“Unless what?” whispered the prince eagerly.</p>

<p>“Unless you will promise us to abdicate
the instant your father dies.”</p>

<p>A dazed look settled on the youth’s face
for an instant.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me,” he asked,
hoarsely, “that you would take my word for
such a thing as that?”</p>

<p>A murmur born of suppressed excitement,
perhaps of protest, broke from the conspirators,
but Posadowski raised his hand for
silence.</p>

<p>“We would take your word, Prince Carlo.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
There is not a Rexanian in all the world
who would not.”</p>

<p>The youth’s face twitched with the effort
he made to suppress the emotion of mingled
astonishment and gratitude that filled his
soul.</p>

<p>“And yet,” he cried, “you would take from
me my throne, deny my right to lead the
people I love, who love me! What madness
blinds your eyes? Would you bring ruin on
the land you pretend to cherish? Think you
that there is in Rexania a republican leader
whose word you would accept as you would
take mine? But I am too deeply grieved at
the news you give me to argue with you
now. Plain as your inconsistency is to my
eyes, this is not the time to point it out to
you. Please leave me for a while. I must
think—think—think. Wait just one moment.
Do not leave me with a false hope in your
heart. Though my father—God be with
him!—were dying a thousand deaths, I
would not, could not, blindly sacrifice the
trust that falls to my care to gratify your
will, and gain my worthless freedom. Better
for me, better for you, better for Rexania,
that I sink beneath the waters of yonder
sun-kissed sea than go hence a false and
recreant prince, damned for all time as a
traitor, a coward, a renegade. Leave me
to my sorrow and my tears. Go, and may
the God that loves our fatherland speak to
your hard hearts and lead you from the error
of your ways. Go!”</p>

<p>Silently the four conspirators turned
and left Prince Carlo to his lonely grief.
Their faces were pale with the conflicting
emotions that tried their souls. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
gigantic Posnovitch trembled, as if with
cold.</p>

<p>“He’s grand,” he muttered, as the quartette
reached the lower hall. “He’s every
inch a king.”</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.</h3>

</div>

<p>Will the reader permit us to place him
somewhere between earth and sky two days
after the events recorded in the last chapter
had occurred? From this exalted position,
and provided, as he is, with far-seeing eyes,
he must observe, with more or less interest,
that the streets of Rexopolis, the capital of
Rexania, are thronged with crowds of people
who move hither and thither with a restlessness
apparently due to constrained excitement
that has not yet crystallized into any
set purpose. Around the palace, he will
notice, regiments of soldiers stand on guard,
while, now and then, up or down the avenues
of the well-laid-out city dash squadrons
of light cavalry. The sight will suggest to
him that Rexopolis, at the crisis at which he
views it, represents a microcosm in which all
that is characteristic of Old-World monarchies
finds physical expression—a restless
and discontented people, an army half-hearted
in its defence of the palace and what
that building represents, mystery and misrepresentation
and misery inside the king’s
abode, and the wild mutterings of protest
and warning outside the sacred precincts of
an anachronistic cult.</p>

<p>But it strains the reader’s eyes to look so
far afield. Back across the wide blue expanse
of the broad Atlantic his gaze returns,
and straight beneath him he sees various people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
who approach each other slowly, ignorant
of the strange fact that the impending
upheaval in a minor city of Europe is to
have a marked influence upon their respective
lives.</p>

<p>Behold Ludovics, the restless victim of too
much patriotism and too little self-control,
pausing in helpless hesitation outside the
gateway of a road-house not many miles
above Harlem Bridge. The afternoon has
grown warm, and Ludovics has walked far
and fast. Is it strange that he craves a
stimulant?</p>

<p>Look forward, farther eastward. If your
eye has not grown weary, you will observe
that a youth and two women are seated on
the piazza of the Country Club, engaged in
the harmless occupation of discussing the
adaptability of the weather and the roads to
a spin on their wheels. Unless our impressions
are deceptive, the youth is Ned Strong,
and one of the women is his sister. You
have not yet been introduced to their companion,
Mrs. Brevoort, but surely you have
heard of the beautiful widow who last season
made herself famous on two continents by
refusing to turn over to an English peer her
fortune and her liberty. There are those who
say that she was sufficiently eccentric to love
her husband and to mourn him dead, but the
impression has prevailed in the Westchester
set of late that what an English duke failed
to accomplish Ned Strong bids fair to compass.</p>

<p>Turning your gaze away from this attractive
trio, after you have noted, perhaps, that
an air of melancholy seems to surround the
tall, lithe figure of Kate Strong, you will observe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
that Norman Benedict has just left a
New York train at the New Rochelle station,
and that his face bears an expression of suppressed
excitement kept in check by a set
purpose that may at any moment encounter
insuperable obstacles. If you watch him a
moment, you will see that he bargains with
the driver of a light, open carriage, and, after
making terms, enters the vehicle and is
driven toward the Sound.</p>

<p>Has your eye grown weary? Surely Prince
Carlo is worthy of a little optic effort on your
part. See him seated on the balcony of the
ramshackle old manor house, his cheek resting
on his hand as he gazes mournfully across
the restless waves of the Sound and wonders
what passes in the palace at Rexopolis.
Could he see, as we have seen, the restless
populace, the armed guards, the busy cavalry,
he would know that a crisis in the fate
of his country is at hand, and the look of
settled melancholy on his handsome face
would change to an expression of mingled
anger and despair. But Prince Carlo is
young, and youth inclines to hope. The
beauty of the scene that lies before him on
this bracing autumnal afternoon is conducive
to an optimistic mood, and, in spite of the
seemingly desperate character of his position,
the young man dreams rather of love than
war, and the smiling face of a fair-haired
American girl comes between him and the
frowning countenance of red-scarred revolution.</p>

<p>Perhaps Prince Carlo is undergoing a temptation
different from any that ever before
assaulted a son of kings. It is possible that
under the influence of a caressing environment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
lulling his senses by the beauty of
earth, and sea and sky and the gentle kisses
of the warm south wind, he thinks with a
shudder of the horrors that surround him in
a palace far away, and longs for the peace
that life in a land where it would be “always
afternoon” would bestow. What if his father
died and he, the crown prince, should never
return to Rexania? What if, taking to his
heart a wife who would be his queen in a
kingdom where no traitors lurked, he should
forever abandon the cares and perils that had
made his father’s existence one long nightmare,
to which death alone could bring relief?
It might be that the historians of his country
would call him, in the years to come, a traitor
to the cause he had been born into the world
to uphold, the Judas Iscariot of age-end monarchy.
But, for all that, his gain would be
peace and love.</p>

<p>Prince Carlo’s temptation was not a mere
weighing of abstract propositions, nor even
the natural inclination of an imaginative
youth to take the flower-bedecked path of
least resistance. There was an influence at
work to make him subservient to the wishes
of the men surrounding him that none of
them suspected and that he himself only
vaguely realized. How great an impression
the few hours he had spent in Kate Strong’s
companionship had made upon him he was
just beginning dimly to appreciate. He found
himself practically unable to compel his
mind to dwell for any great length of time
on the weighty problems that were his to
solve. He would discover, to his dismay,
that while mentally in search of a path that
would lead him in honor from the difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
that beset him, his mind obstinately refused
to confine itself to his immediate environment
and all that was involved therein, and
would devote itself to reproducing for his
delight the tones of a maiden’s voice, the
gleam of her eloquent eyes, the fascinations
of her gestures and her smiles.</p>

<p>He upon whom rested the destinies of a
nation—perhaps the future of institutions
hallowed by time and claiming a divine origin—had
become little more than a love-sick
youth, gazing dreamily upon the heaving
bosom of a land-locked sea and longing for
the presence of the woman his young heart
craved.</p>

<p>Thus beneath us have we seen a few of the
countless millions upon whom the September
sun shone down that day; and we know
that in their comings and their goings they
wove unconsciously that web of destiny
whose warp and woof fashion the garment
that hides the mystery of life.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

</div>

<p>“Woman in bicycle costume is an acquired
taste,” Ned Strong had once remarked to a
friend. That was before Mrs. Brevoort had
taken to wheeling. She had converted him
to a belief in the artistic possibilities of a
bifurcated dress for women. He had come
to the final conclusion that the desirability
of a bicycle costume, so far as the gentler
sex is concerned, must remain wholly a local
issue. Experience was teaching him that
generalizations regarding the progressive
woman of to-day are worthless. Furthermore,
he had learned that whether or not
he admired their ways and costumes made
little difference to the women of his set.
The iconoclastic tendency of recent years
finds no more striking illustration than in
the fact that women no longer sacrifice their
comfort to their dress for the sake of man’s
approval, but dare to be unconventional for
the sake of their own comfort.</p>

<p>And Ned Strong was obliged to acknowledge
to himself that Mrs. Brevoort, dark,
<i lang="fr">piquante</i>, vivacious, presented an extremely
attractive picture on this September afternoon
as she sat gazing at the blue waters of
the Sound, equipped for a long ride on her
wheel.</p>

<p>That Kate Strong was a much more striking
and impressive figure than Mrs. Brevoort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
was a fact that had not appealed to the young
man’s mind. Perhaps he had not observed
his sister critically. Or it may be that he
had so long taken it for granted that Kate
always made a good appearance that he was
not inclined to waste time on the question as
to the adaptability of a bicycle costume to
his sister’s use. At all events, the youth
found pleasure in confining his attentions to
Mrs. Brevoort, and failed to notice that his
sister’s face wore an expression of melancholy
and that there was a listlessness in her
manner that the warmth of the day could not
wholly explain.</p>

<p>“And you have heard nothing more about
him?” asked Mrs. Brevoort, gazing interestedly
at Ned Strong. “It seems very strange
that he has never written you a line.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it?” cried the young man. “And
he was such a thoroughbred in his manner
and appearance! Wasn’t he, Kate?”</p>

<p>“He was very attractive,” answered his
sister, somewhat reluctantly, it seemed. “I
feel sure that some day we shall find an explanation
to the mystery.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” exclaimed Mrs. Brevoort,
airily. “You see, I don’t take a bit
of stock in these foreigners. I have seen so
much of them! It may be bad form on my
part, but I prefer an American gentleman to
the most fascinating European that ever
claimed descent from Charlemagne or William
the Conqueror.” She cast a mischievous,
challenging glance at Ned Strong, and
went on: “There’s something about monarchical
countries that begets ideal lovers
but impossible husbands. The greatest complaint
over absentee landlords on the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
side comes from American girls who have
married titled foreigners.”</p>

<p>Ned Strong laughed. “On behalf of my
fellow-countrymen I thank you, Mrs. Brevoort.
It is too bad that your convictions
have not a greater following here among us.”</p>

<p>“So much the worse for those who do not
agree with me. How much can an American
girl know about a titled foreigner who
comes over here looking for a rich wife?
Take the case you have just been telling me
about,” continued Mrs. Brevoort, vivaciously.
“This fascinating youth called himself
‘Count Szalaki.’ How easy it was for you
to discover that there was no such title in
Rexania! ’Twas surprisingly clumsy on his
part.”</p>

<p>“That’s one reason that leads me to think,”
remarked Ned, “that there is something more
in the affair than a mere adventurer’s escapade.
If he had been a fraud he would have
been more careful in his choice of a name.
If he was, as I have sometimes suspected, a
man very high in rank, who wished to disguise
his identity, he would have chosen a
title that did not exist, taking it for granted
that we would respect his wish to remain unknown.
There are royal personages on the
other side who travel under names that one
cannot find in Burke’s Peerage or the Almanach
de Gotha.”</p>

<p>“That’s merely a matter of form,” exclaimed
Mrs. Brevoort, glancing at Kate.
“Everybody knows who they are, wherever
they go. I was introduced to a king in Paris
who had chosen to trot around under the
name of Mr. Smith, but it was a very thin
disguise. He was such a wretched conversationalist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
that I knew at once that he concealed
a throne behind his stupidity. A real
Mr. Smith could have talked about something
besides the weather.”</p>

<p>Kate smiled at the sarcastic little woman’s
words.</p>

<p>“What a thorough democrat you are, Mrs.
Brevoort!” she remarked. “I almost suspect
that you intend to go in for politics.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” cried Mrs. Brevoort enthusiastically.
“If we don’t take part in public
affairs, other women will. I believe it is our
duty to raise the tone of politics by taking
an interest in them. If the men of our class
won’t do their duty by the State, it is for us
to take their place.” She looked at Ned
Strong defiantly.</p>

<p>“I suspect,” he remarked, cautiously, “that
you do not approve of my indifference to
public affairs, Mrs. Brevoort.”</p>

<p>“Most assuredly I do not,” she exclaimed
emphatically. “A youth who claims a divine
right to occupy a European throne and
defends that assumed right with cannon and
gunpowder is, to my mind, in a false position,
but he is more consistent than a young
American who possesses the prerogative of
the ballot and won’t take the trouble to go
to the polls to vote.”</p>

<p>Ned Strong laughed merrily. “What a
long memory you have, Mrs. Brevoort! It
is nearly a year since you learned that I
failed to register last fall, and now you bring
a sweeping accusation against me. I fear
you do not find me possessed of the saving
grace of patriotism.”</p>

<p>“Patriotism!” cried the youth’s accuser.
“Surely, if you have it, it finds queer ways<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
of expression, Mr. Strong. You fail to vote,
and yet you are forever denouncing this
country for going to the dogs. I really believe
that I have heard you crack a joke at
the expense of George Washington.”</p>

<p>A smile of amusement crossed Kate
Strong’s face. “He deserves what you are
giving him, Mrs. Brevoort. Ned is a thorough
believer in his divine right to let other
people save the country.”</p>

<p>“This is unfair,” cried the young man,
with assumed annoyance. “I am outnumbered
two to one. You have me at a disadvantage.
But I will not attempt now, Mrs.
Brevoort, to defend my position. And, luckily
for me, here comes my chance for escape.
You cannot talk politics on the wheel, you
two. Are you ready to mount? It is just
three o’clock, and we are in good time for a
long spin.”</p>

<p>A boy in livery had brought their wheels
to the front of the club-house, and, mounting
quickly, the trio sped down the pathway
toward the entrance that opened on to the
grounds from the main highway. Mrs. Brevoort
and Ned Strong led the way, and Kate
followed them, a flush of physical enjoyment
mounting to her cheeks as she chased the
south wind inland.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

</div>

<p>Mrs. Brevoort and Ned Strong sped along
in silence for a time. The roads were dry
and hard, and there was enough life in the
breeze that had kissed the sea to make even
violent exercise seductive. Ned’s companion
was an enthusiastic and accomplished
wheelwoman, and she pedalled on merrily
by his side, sometimes smiling up at him in
the mere joy of physical exertion. They had
reached the high-road, and were rapidly making
their way toward New Rochelle when
Ned turned to his companion and said:</p>

<p>“Tell me, Mrs. Brevoort, what is your
idea of Kate’s feeling toward Count Szalaki?
Do you think she is really interested
in the man?”</p>

<p>“How stupid you are!” cried the little
woman, who seldom failed to display either
real or assumed enthusiasm regarding any
given topic of conversation. Turning in her
saddle, she looked back, and saw that Kate
Strong was wheeling steadily forward a hundred
yards to their rear. “But what else
could I expect? All men are stupid about
certain matters. Of course your sister is interested
in Count Szalaki. So am I. I am
wild to see the boy. From what you both
say of him, he must be simply irresistible.”</p>

<p>Ned Strong frowned and impatiently increased
the speed of his wheel. He knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
how to withstand the coquetry of a young
girl, but the “in-and-out running of a widow,”
as he called it to himself, kept him in
a state of nervous worry most of the time.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” he remarked crossly, “that
what a man needs in these days to make him
interesting are black curly hair and an air of
mystery. In that case I’m out of it completely.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brevoort laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“What a jealous creature you are, Mr.
Strong! Your wife will have a sad life of
it, unless she is a very clever woman.”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to marry,” remarked the
youth sternly. “What a fool I’d be to sell
my birthright for a mess of affectation! And
that’s what a woman is to-day—simply a
mess of affectation.”</p>

<p>“What an elegant expression!” cried Mrs.
Brevoort, a gleam of malice in her laughing
eyes as she looked up at the youth, who was
gazing stubbornly forward and pushing the
pedals of his wheel as though he had suffered
a great wrong and was obliged to work for
his living. “But it does you credit, Mr.
Strong. It indicates on your part a remote
but more or less intimate acquaintance with
biblical lore.”</p>

<p>“But there’s one thing certain,” continued
the young man, not heeding her sarcasm,
“and that is that if I <em>should</em> marry I would
not tie myself down to a silly girl who might
at any moment meet a curly-haired man with
a title and leave me in the lurch.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brevoort laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>“How self-confident you are, little boy!”
she exclaimed. “Let me tell you, sir, it is
my opinion that you will marry a blue-eyed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
golden-haired young doll, who will make
you believe that you are the most wonderful
man on earth and that she is the happiest
woman. I can see it all in my mind’s eye.
You prize your freedom, as you think, more
than most men. It is just your kind that
fall victims to the sweet-faced, blond-haired
little vixens who make the most tyrannical
wives in the world. Do you like the prediction?”</p>

<p>The youth turned a frowning face to his
<i lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i>. “Why, oh, why, Mrs. Brevoort,”
he cried, “will you check the natural flow
of my spirits by so dire a prophecy? Think
of the awful fate that awaits me, if your
words are true! I acknowledge that I have
seen other men, perhaps as hard to suit as I
am myself, falling into the clutches of spotless
young girls who have lured them into
the awful maelstrom of marriage; but I swear
to you that I shall profit by their experience.
I should never marry because I wanted a
parlor ornament. When I give up my liberty,
I shall insist upon a <i lang="la">quid pro quo</i>.”</p>

<p>“What in the world is that, Mr. Strong?”
cried Mrs. Brevoort, looking shocked as she
glanced up at him with exaggerated amazement.</p>

<p>“That’s Latin,” answered the youth densely.
“It’s a dead language, but I used it for
a very live purpose. I am not talking at
random, you know, Mrs. Brevoort. There is
method in my madness.”</p>

<p>Ned Strong looked down at his companion
meaningly, but she refused to meet his gaze.</p>

<p>“But method never yet saved madness
from disaster,” she remarked, sagely.</p>

<p>Her words seemed to check the youth’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
impetuosity, for he cast a pleading glance
at her averted face and then wheeled forward
in silence for a time.</p>

<p>“The fact is,” he began again, after he had
renewed his courage, “the fact is, Mrs. Brevoort,
that you don’t understand me.”</p>

<p>A smile that he could not see from his exalted
perch crossed the widow’s face. It is
only a very young man who ever dares to
tell a woman that she does not weigh him
justly. The average man may deceive other
men; it takes a genius to blind a woman.</p>

<p>“Explain yourself,” she urged, not too
warmly.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to give you the impression,”
he went on, hesitatingly, “you know,
that I don’t admire women—that is, some
women, don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“I see,” she answered pitilessly; “you
admire women—some women, that is—for
anything, everything, but matrimony. You
said a few moments ago that you would
never marry.”</p>

<p>“Did I?” he asked, almost penitently. “I
had forgotten that I went so far. But, I assure
you, I didn’t mean to imply, you know,
that under certain circumstances and—don’t
you see—if I got the promise of just the
right woman, that I shouldn’t be very glad
to give up my freedom, don’t you know;
that is, if it was perfectly agreeable to her,
of course.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brevoort laughed outright, as they
bowled down a long hill at the top of which
the Strongs’ manor-house peeped above the
trees.</p>

<p>“You are the most amusing man I know,
Mr. Strong,” she exclaimed, as they reached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
the level road and moved forward more
slowly. “If you were more consistent, you
wouldn’t be half so much fun.”</p>

<p>The youth was not altogether pleased at
her remark. He glanced at her searchingly.</p>

<p>“You may do me an injustice, Mrs. Brevoort,”
he said firmly. “It is more than
possible that I am more consistent than you
suspect.”</p>

<p>“In what?” she asked, rather recklessly,
looking up at him mischievously. The expression
in his eyes caused her a pang of
regret at the challenge she had made.</p>

<p>“In my ideas regarding matrimony, in my
convictions as to the woman I should wish to
marry,” he answered, meaningly. “Shall I
explain?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brevoort gave a questioning glance
at his face and realized that he must not explain.
She turned in her saddle, as if seeking
the support of an ally at a crisis that
must be averted at any cost.</p>

<p>“Why, where is Kate?” she cried, checking
the speed of her wheel and gazing back
eagerly along the road and up the hill that
crept toward the manor-house.</p>

<p>Ned Strong turned, rather impatiently,
and saw that the road was deserted, save that
half-way up the hill an open vehicle, that he
and Mrs. Brevoort had been too absorbed in
conversation to notice when it passed them,
was slowly mounting toward the summit.</p>

<p>“We must go back and find her,” cried
Mrs. Brevoort, dismounting from her wheel
and looking at Ned anxiously.</p>

<p>“It would be useless,” he said, stubbornly.
“She has grown tired of riding alone and has
gone back to the club-house. Or perhaps she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
has stopped at the lodge to speak to Rudolph.
That’s our old homestead up there,
you know, Mrs. Brevoort. Really, I don’t
think it would pay us to climb that hill on
the remote chance of finding her. We’ll turn
off the main road just above here and get
back to the club-house at once if you wish.
It’s a shorter cut than we could make by retracing
our road over the hill.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brevoort reluctantly remounted her
wheel.</p>

<p>“If you had not talked so much nonsense,”
she remarked unjustly to Ned Strong as they
resumed their way, “we would not have lost
track of Kate.”</p>

<p>“A remark that I consider highly complimentary,”
commented the youth, smiling
contentedly down at the disturbed countenance
of Mrs. Brevoort.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.</h3>

</div>

<p>Posadowski passed through Prince Carlo’s
sleeping-room and stepped out upon the balcony.
The heir to a throne was still dreaming
of love and peace in a land where Cupid
should reign supreme, as the arch-conspirator
joined him. The young man’s face was
pensive with the gentle longings that tinged
his revery with sadness. He turned toward
Posadowski and said cordially:</p>

<p>“Be seated. I wish to talk with you.”</p>

<p>The clear gray eyes of the exiled Rexanian
rested searchingly on the pale, clean-cut face
of the youth, and he smiled benignly as he
drew a chair toward his captive and, seating
himself, awaited the latter’s pleasure.</p>

<p>“How long have you lived in this country,
Posadowski?” asked the prince, abandoning
his smiling visions with an effort and returning
to the dreary realities of life.</p>

<p>“Nearly ten years,” answered the revolutionist,
whose gray hair proved that he was
older than his smooth pink and white complexion
would have indicated.</p>

<p>“I wish to ask you a few questions,” continued
Prince Carlo. “I feel—in spite of the
fact that you deceived me at our first meeting—that
in the larger matters pertaining
to the questions at issue between us I can
trust you implicitly. I give you credit, Posadowski,
for being a man of good intentions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
and honest in your avowed love for Rexania.”</p>

<p>The arch-conspirator bowed gratefully, in
acknowledgment of the generous words of
the man he had wronged.</p>

<p>“Tell me frankly,” went on the prince, “do
you find, Posadowski, that in this land of
democracy the people of the lower classes—for
I learn that there are class distinctions in
America—are in better case than the working-people
of Rexania? Compare, for instance,
the rich and the poor in Rexopolis
and the rich and the poor in New York. Is
there not more awful poverty in yonder city
than in my capital across the sea? Conversely,
is there in Rexania a nobleman who
wields over the lives of others an authority
as tyrannical as that exercised by the great
landlords of New York?”</p>

<p>Posadowski gazed at Prince Carlo in bewilderment.
He had come to point out to
his royal captive the far-reaching influence
his abdication of a crown would have upon
the oppressed millions of the human race
who still live and struggle and perish beneath
the crushing weight of thrones and
what those thrones demand; and, lo, this incarnation
of obsolete systems and archaic
theories had asked him a few pertinent and
practical questions that rendered Posadowski’s
present mission seemingly absurd. For
the arch-conspirator was a clear-headed,
honest-hearted man, whose constitutional
detestation for shams had long ago made him
a rebel against monarchy, and now rendered
him dumb as he slowly took in the full significance
of the line of inquiry Prince Carlo had
put forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>“You do not answer, Posadowski,” went on
Prince Carlo, his voice and manner growing
sterner as his words flowed more freely.
“Do you know, man, why I came to this
country, why I defied my father’s wishes and
ran a risk greater even than I imagined at
the moment? I wished to see for myself
what popular government has really done
for a great people in a century of time.
They told me on the steamer, these New
Yorkers, facts that made even the hard heart
of a king bleed for the poor devils who
chased the <i lang="la">ignis fatuus</i> of freedom into the
very stronghold of human tyranny. These
are harsh words, Posadowski. Do you dare
tell me that they are false—you who know
the East Side of that great city in which
you, and thousands of deluded Europeans,
have toiled in misery that makes the lot of a
Rexanian peasant easy, even luxurious, in
comparison? Perhaps I have been misinformed.
Perhaps I have failed to read aright
the newspapers that have come to my hand
since I reached this strange, distorted land.
But what I have heard, what I have read,
forces me to the conviction that no Rexanian
in Rexopolis has ever suffered from
a form of tyranny so pitiless as that which
keeps our countrymen in New York poorer
and more hopeless than they were in their
native land. If I am wrong, if I am deceived
through insufficient data, I am sure
you will set me right. Speak, man. Have
I told the truth?”</p>

<p>Posadowski was silent for a moment.
Then he answered, a note of stubbornness in
his voice:</p>

<p>“Industrial conditions here are not as they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
should be. That is true. But surely a monarchy
would not set them right.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” cried Prince Carlo, “that is just the
point. A monarchy would not solve the
problems of this country. On the other
hand, a republic would not remedy the defects
in Rexania’s body politic. I am liberal
in my views, Posadowski. I will grant
you that if I should mount the throne of
Rexania I could not rule after the fashion of
my great-grandfather. The king and his
people must walk hand-in-hand to-day, not
at sword’s points. But let Rexania become
a republic on the instant, and what would result?
Dissensions among the people, and
political chaos: possibly the annexation of
the country by a stronger power on our border.
You talk of the selfishness of kings.
Are they not the most heroic figures of the
age? Take my father—God be with him! He
has loved Rexania with a devoted unselfishness
that only those who have been near him
can appreciate. Weary, sad at heart, sometimes
almost hopeless, he has had it in his
power to accumulate a vast fortune, put it
into portable shape, and abandon his country
for a land in which he could live in peace
and idleness. Do you think that such a step
has been no temptation to him? You have
so long looked at only one side of this matter
that it will be hard for you to realize the full
force of my question. I tell you that my
father has loved Rexania with more fervor
than you have ever felt for our fatherland,
that he has displayed more courage and patriotic
devotion in his life than any one of his
rebellious subjects has ever shown, and that
he has understood the practical necessities of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
our country’s environment better than the
dreamers who have fostered discontent among
the people. My father has been a grand and
unselfish man, Posadowski, and you—you
would crucify him.”</p>

<p>The arch-conspirator had grown pale as
the youth, with a calmness that was almost
uncanny in its exhibition of self-control, had
given voice to the thoughts that had taken
form in his mind during his days of captivity.
Presently he spoke again, observing
that Posadowski had, at that moment, no
arguments to advance.</p>

<p>“What dire calamities you may bring upon
Rexania by holding me here a prisoner I dare
to contemplate. Granting that you keep me
captive from the very highest motives of patriotism,
can you not see that you are endangering
the very cause for which you strive?
Let us suppose that my father dies and that
Rexania becomes a republic. Unless you
kill me, Posadowski, I shall eventually return
to Europe. Not only that, but I shall be
placed upon the throne of Rexania by forces
against which your republican brethren could
make no resistance worthy of the name.
You are a clear-headed man, Posadowski.
I can see by your face that what I have said
has made an impression upon you that will
give you, surely, a different point of view.”</p>

<p>A grim smile crossed the arch-conspirator’s
countenance. “I will acknowledge, Prince
Carlo, that I have not at this moment arguments
at hand to answer the line of reasoning
you have advanced. I am a slow thinker,
and, as you can well understand, I am confronted
by a dilemma of tremendous import.
I must ask you to give me time to weigh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
your words. If, after close consideration, I
reach your conclusions—a result that necessitates
the rejection of convictions that I have
cherished for many years—I will discuss
frankly with you the step that we should
take.”</p>

<p>Posadowski arose and approached the
prince.</p>

<p>“Let me ask you, Prince Carlo,” he said,
before taking his leave, “let me ask you not
to discuss the matters we have in hand with
my colleagues. There is not one among
them who would have allowed you to explain
your position as I have done. You understand
me?”</p>

<p>“Fully,” answered the prince, smiling up
at the gray-eyed Rexanian, “I understand
you, Posadowski, and I trust you.”</p>

<p>At that very moment Ludovics was making
his exit from a road-house a mile away, the
fumes of brandy imprisoned in the cells of
his brain. With the money that Norman
Benedict had left for him at the restaurant
in St. Mark’s Square, Ludovics had purchased
a revolver and had gone on a hunting
expedition into Westchester County. It
was big game that he was after—nothing less
than a king who was making wild merriment
at his expense; and where that king was
Ludovics well knew.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

</div>

<p>Just below the lodge gate, and at the very
top of the hill, Kate Strong had fallen from
her bicycle and sprained her ankle. The
sudden and excruciating pain had begotten a
momentary faintness that had prevented her
from crying out in time to attract the attention
of Mrs. Brevoort and her brother, who
were at that instant coasting down the hillside
at a merry pace.</p>

<p>Dizzy and sick with the shock she had
sustained, Kate, realizing that she could not
recall her companions, decided to arouse Rudolph
at the lodge and send him at once for
a physician. The pain in her ankle seemed
to grow worse every moment, and she began
to doubt her ability to reach the gate of her
ancestral home, when an open carriage was
dragged over the top of the hill by a panting
horse, seemingly one of Westchester County’s
Revolutionary relics. The owner and driver
of the ancient steed and ramshackle vehicle
was wont to remark solemnly that his faithful
horse had withstood the wear and tear
of years and labor until the bicycle had begun
to haunt his footsteps. The effect of
wheels operated by men upon the nervous
system of an old-fashioned and conservative
horse, whose career of usefulness had been
rendered possible by the prosperity of the
livery-stable business, cannot be appreciated
by a flippant mind. In the case under our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
immediate consideration, the sight of a prostrate
bicycle lying by the roadside affected
the aged steed instantly. A snort, perhaps
of triumph, burst from the supersensitive
horse as it planted its forefeet stubbornly in
the dust of the roadway and looked down at
the overturned wheel.</p>

<p>The sudden halting of the carriage aroused
Norman Benedict from an intense concentration
of mind. He had been attempting to
decide upon a course of action in case the
rather unpromising clew he was now following
should not result in the discovery of a
Rexanian who, as he had been told, had
charge of a deserted manor-house somewhere
in the neighborhood. The sight that met
his eyes caused the reporter to spring hastily
from the carriage.</p>

<p>“Are you badly hurt?” he asked Kate
Strong, who had managed to rise to her feet
by the aid of the fence toward which she had
crept. She stood with one hand on the railing,
her face pale and drawn.</p>

<p>“I’ve sprained my ankle, I think,” she answered,
trying to smile gratefully at the
stranger’s kindly interest in her plight. “If
I could get to the lodge, there, our man Rudolph
could make me comfortable until a
doctor reached me.”</p>

<p>“Draw up here,” cried Benedict to his
driver. “Put your hand on my arm, Miss—Miss——”</p>

<p>“Miss Strong,” answered Kate, resting her
hand on his elbow and hobbling toward the
carriage.</p>

<p>“Now drive slowly up to that gate,” ordered
Benedict again, as he turned and lifted
Kate’s bicycle from the ground and wheeled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
it along by the side of his improvised ambulance.</p>

<p>As the carriage stopped in front of the
lodge gate, the reporter rang a bell whose
vibrations in these days of an international
crisis always gave Rudolph Smolenski’s
nerves a severe shock. Since the Crown
Prince of Rexania had become his prisoner,
the lodge-keeper never opened the gate without
first making a close and lengthy examination
of those who craved his attention.
The tradesmen and urchins who had occasion
to beard the Rexanian in his lair had noticed
of late that he had grown surly and unsociable,
and that he allowed no one to pass the
gloomy portals of a domain over which his
long service had rendered him practically autocratic.</p>

<p>At the moment at which Norman Benedict
pulled the knob that set a bell within the
lodge a-trembling, Rudolph was deep in revery,
and wondering what would be the outcome
of Posadowski’s mission to the prince.
If he had known that at that very instant
Prince Carlo was advancing arguments that
tended to shake the arch-conspirator’s devotion
to the enterprise in which the Rexanian
exiles were engaged, Rudolph would have
felt even greater dissatisfaction than influenced
his mood at the time. He had begun
to grow impatient and restless. He had almost
become a convert to Ludovics’ belief
in heroic measures. The fact was that Rudolph
felt that he was risking more than
any one of his colleagues in this lawless effort
to make European history in a secluded corner
of Westchester County. The longer the temporizing
policy pursued by Posadowski was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
continued, the more certain was Rudolph of
the ultimate discovery of his secret and the
loss of a place that was in all respects satisfactory
to his indolent and rather unsociable
nature. The thought of returning to the
East Side to slave in a sweater’s establishment
filled him with horror.</p>

<p>There was something ominous in the sharp
summons of the bell that caused him to lay
aside his pipe with trembling hand, while
his flabby cheeks turned white. He could
think of no one who would be likely to disturb
the lonely lodge at that hour, unless, as
he reflected with conflicting emotions, Ludovics,
the impetuous, had found his way back
to the centre of high pressure.</p>

<p>Hurrying toward the entrance, his heart
beating with unpleasant rapidity, Rudolph
opened a peep-hole in the iron gate and
looked out. His eyes first rested on Norman
Benedict: there was nothing in the reporter’s
appearance to increase the lodge-keeper’s apprehensions.
But, as his glance fell upon the
carriage, drawn up on the outside of the antique
stepping-stone to the left of the gateway,
a cold perspiration broke out upon his
hands and face, and his short, puffy legs
trembled beneath him. He had seen his employer’s
daughter often enough to recognize
instantly the pale, patrician face of Kate
Strong. For an instant consternation rendered
him powerless. Then he turned from
the gate and ran frantically toward the
manor-house. Rukacs was on guard on the
front piazza.</p>

<p>“Rukacs,” cried the lodge-keeper, excitedly,
“keep close behind the pillars, and don’t
show yourself where you can be seen from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
the lodge. Tell Posadowski and the others
to keep out of sight. And be sure that not a
sound issues from this house until you hear
from me again. Miss Strong, daughter of
my employer, is at the lodge gate. She
looks very pale: I think she may have fainted,
or something of that kind. But keep a close
watch, Rukacs. I’ll do my best to hold her
at the lodge, but you must keep your eye on
the game.”</p>

<p>Rudolph, his legs working clumsily under
the pressure of a great crisis, rushed back to
the gate, leaving Rukacs white with dismay.
The lodge, as he passed it, seemed to tremble
with the noise of a bell that froze the Rexanian’s
soul with its threatening insistence.
Opening the gate, he confronted Norman
Benedict.</p>

<p>“Miss Strong has sprained her ankle,” said
the reporter, who realized that this was no
time for padding his news. “Come out and
help me to get her on to a sofa. What are
you staring at, man? Don’t you speak English?”</p>

<p>Rudolph made a strong effort of will and
approached the carriage. A spasm of pain
crossed Kate’s face as she gave one hand to
Rudolph and the other to Benedict and
stepped to the ground.</p>

<p>“I will go into the lodge, Rudolph,” she
said. “I couldn’t stand the motion of that
old conveyance a moment longer.”</p>

<p>The lodge-keeper was white and speechless
as he helped the injured girl into the parlor
of the lodge, while the reporter drew the only
comfortable piece of furniture in the room,
an antique lounge, toward the front windows
and arranged a tattered pillow at its head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>“There is a doctor not far from here?”
asked Benedict, turning to the lodge-keeper
and giving him a penetrating glance. There
was something in Rudolph’s manner that
struck the quick-witted reporter as peculiar.</p>

<p>“Half a mile down the road,” answered
Rudolph, his voice unsteady.</p>

<p>“Get into the carriage and bring him here
at once,” ordered Benedict, sharply, noting
instantly the reluctance Rudolph’s manner
expressed. Kate Strong also noticed her
retainer’s hesitation.</p>

<p>“Do as this gentleman directs, Rudolph,”
she commanded; and the lodge-keeper, seeing
no alternative at hand, turned and left
the room with hesitating steps.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Miss Strong,” remarked Benedict,
stationing himself at a window from
which he could see the roadway, “your man
is a foreigner?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Kate. “He is a Rexanian,
I believe.” Her reply caused the reporter
to regret for the moment that he had
allowed the lodge-keeper to leave his sight.
Of what significance was a girl with a
sprained ankle, compared with the greatest
newspaper “beat” of the year?</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

</div>

<p>“You are to drive me half a mile down the
road and back again,” said Rudolph sullenly
to the aged Jehu who had carried Nemesis in
a tumble-down vehicle to the gateway of the
lodge. “Don’t stop to think about it. The
sooner its done the sooner its over.”</p>

<p>With this philosophical remark, the Rexanian
entered the carriage and seated himself
gloomily behind the taciturn and dispirited
driver. There was a melancholy aspect to
the conveyance as it moved slowly away
from the lodge gate. The broken-hearted
steed seemed to be plunged in a gloomy revery
regarding the iconoclastic influence of
bicycles; the driver cracked his tattered
whip in a hopeless way, as if he realized the
impotence of his efforts to give an appearance
of life and activity to his antiquated
turnout; while Rudolph’s face wore an expression
of mingled apprehension and dismay
that grew more intense the farther he rolled
away from the manor-house.</p>

<p>It was this depressing caravan that met the
restless gaze of Ludovics about a quarter of
a mile below the lodge. He had cut loose
from his alcoholic moorings at the road-house,
and was tacking toward Rudolph’s
ill-fated residence with a purpose much more
steady than his steps. He paused by the
side of the roadway and aroused Rudolph
from his dark forebodings by a loud cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>“Rudolph!” shouted Ludovics. “Rudolph!
Have they turned you out? Good! I knew
you were the right kind! Here, man, give
me the grip.”</p>

<p>The little inebriate had reached the side of
the carriage and seized Rudolph’s cold, damp,
flabby hand.</p>

<p>The lodge-keeper gazed calmly at his unruly
compatriot. The thought had entered
his mind that it was possible to save time by
sending Ludovics for the doctor while he
and his disheartened driver returned to the
lodge.</p>

<p>“Ludovics,” remarked Rudolph, diplomatically,
“I’m glad to see you.” Then he
leaned down over the back wheel and whispered,
“Be cautious, Ludovics. The driver
there is not one of us.”</p>

<p>Ludovics flashed a glance of withering
scorn at the bent back of the phlegmatic
Jehu.</p>

<p>“I see,” he said, with drunken gravity,
“you have hypnotized him, Rudolph. It is
well.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it,” answered the lodge-keeper,
who was weighing all the chances and
trying to reach a decision. Finally he said,
“Ludovics, I must get back to the lodge at
once. You passed a large white house with
pillars in front of it, about a quarter of a
mile below here. There’s a sign on the gate
reading ‘Dr. C. H. Moore.’ Now I want you
to go back there and tell the doctor to come
to the lodge at once. Do you understand
me?”</p>

<p>Ludovics drew himself up haughtily, as if
Rudolph had cast a slur upon his intellectual
ability.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>“Of course I understand you,” he answered,
petulantly. Then a vivid suspicion flashed
through his befuddled brain.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Rudolph,” he cried, in low, feverish
tones, “is he sick? Didn’t his food
agree with him? Ha ha! Well done, Rudolph!
I knew you were the right kind, Rudolph.
He needs a doctor, does he? Good!
I’ll go and get the doctor, Rudolph. Give
him something more to eat and drink before
the doctor gets there, brother. He’s a stubborn
boy, you know. But I trust you, Rudolph,
I trust you. Dr. Moore, you said?
Dr. Moore? Down the road? Very good,
Rudolph. I’m off.” Ludovics laughed with
a fiendish glee that horrified even the unimpressionable
lodge-keeper.</p>

<p>“Be careful what you say, Ludovics,” he
said, harshly. “Simply ring the bell and
say that Dr. Moore is wanted at the Strongs’
manor-house. Understand me! Don’t talk
too much, or you may get into trouble.
Now go.”</p>

<p>Leaning forward, Rudolph directed the
driver to arouse himself and his horse from
lethargy and return to the lodge gate. A
moment later the broken-spirited horse was
retracing his steps hopelessly, while Rudolph
was leaning back in his seat in a more contented
frame of mind. He had saved at least
ten minutes by entrusting his mission to
Ludovics.</p>

<p>The latter had turned his back on the vehicle
and was making his way down the road
at a pace that indicated a set purpose and a
slight recovery from alcoholic domination on
his part. Suddenly he paused, looked back
at the retreating carriage, and, leaving the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
road, leaned against a fence and indulged for
a moment in an inward debate. Then he
took from a pocket in his coat a flask that he
had purchased at the road-house, and, removing
the cork, swallowed a fiery mouthful
of the raw liquor.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he said argumentatively to
himself, “I wonder if Rudolph is a truly
patriotic cook? There’s a king up here in
Westchester County who needs a doctor. I’m
going for the doctor. I look well, don’t I,
Ludovics, getting a doctor for a sick king? I
wish I knew how sick he is. If he’s as sick
of himself as I am of kings, he’ll die anyway.”
He staggered to the road and turned
again toward the manor-house.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’m a success going for doctors,”
he mused. “I do better when I’m
going for kings.” He placed an unsteady
hand on the rear pocket of his trousers and
satisfied himself that the revolver he had
purchased with a part of Norman Benedict’s
gratuity was in its place.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing so good for a sick king
as pills,” he muttered. “Pills! Pills made
of lead! They’re much more certain than
Rudolph’s cooking. Rudolph means well,
but he doesn’t drink enough brandy.”</p>

<p>As this conclusion forced itself upon him,
he stopped again and drew fresh patriotic
inspiration from his flask. It was beginning
to grow dark as Ludovics reached the high
fence that enclosed the grounds of the manor-house
and ran up flush with the front wall of
the lodge. The sun had sunk in the west
like a glowing cannon-ball blushing for its
crimes.</p>

<p>“It’s lucky I’m small,” mused Ludovics, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
he nimbly mounted the railing and let himself
down on the other side. For a moment
it struck him as curious that he could climb
a fence with more assurance than he could
follow a roadway.</p>

<p>“That must be good brandy,” he muttered.
“It doesn’t help my walking much, but it
makes me climb like a cat.”</p>

<p>Stealthily he made his way through the
tangled grass that covered the lawn until he
stood beneath the balcony at the rear of the
manor-house. The waters of the Sound were
leaden-hued, and the gathering gloom of
night gave a dreary aspect to the scene before
him.</p>

<p>“The doctor has come,” said Ludovics to
himself, a mocking smile overspreading his
face as he glanced upward and saw how easy
it would be for a man of his weight and
agility to reach the second story of the manor-house.
“Just where my patient is, I don’t
know, but I’m almost sure that Rudolph said
he was going to put the king in the rear
room on the second floor.” The cold, damp
breeze that had arisen when the sun went
down chilled the murderous little Rexanian
to the marrow: another pull at the flask was
necessary to check the trembling of his
hands.</p>

<p>“I’ll cure him,” he continued, leaning
against one of the posts that supported the
balcony. “I’ll cure him. My medicine chest
is ready for use. It never fails. When I
doctor a king—eh, Ludovics?—he’s never
sick again, is he? Rudolph’s cooking is not
so sure as my little pills. One pill in a vital
part, and the man is never sick again! Isn’t
that wonderful? Never sick again!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>Thus muttering to himself, Ludovics began
to climb the post at the southern end of the
balcony, his teeth gleaming in the half-light
as he grinned maliciously, while his eyes
glanced with feverish eagerness at a ray of
light that flared from a window above him.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

</div>

<p>Norman Benedict had removed Kate
Strong’s legging and the long buttoned shoe
that had covered her sprained ankle, and had
deftly bound up the injured member with a
handkerchief, after he had relieved the pain
by applying cold water and a gentle massage.</p>

<p>“You have been very kind to me,” said
Kate, gratefully, as she leaned back on the
sofa and realized how much more comfortable
the reporter’s skill had made her feel.
“I owe you a great debt of gratitude.” How
much she was indebted to Benedict she did
not fully realize, for he had been under a
strong temptation to follow Rudolph at any
cost when he had learned that the lodge-keeper
was the very Rexanian he had come
up into Westchester to find.</p>

<p>“Your man, there,” said Benedict, questioningly,
glancing at his watch, “has he been
long in your service?”</p>

<p>“Several years,” answered Kate. “I believe
he was exiled from Rexania after the
revolution of ten years ago.”</p>

<p>Her remark tended to increase the reporter’s
interest in the lodge-keeper.</p>

<p>“They are a curious people, those Rexanians,”
he remarked, drawing a chair toward
the sofa and seating himself where he
could watch Kate’s face. “I have seen something
of them on the East Side.”</p>

<p>Kate felt an almost irresistible desire to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
confess to the youth that they were a race in
which she took at that moment an interest
that was founded on a most unhappy incident.</p>

<p>“You see,” Benedict went on, noting the
animated expression on her face, “I am a
newspaper reporter, Miss Strong, and in my
work I come into contact with many curious
phases of life and queer kinds of people in
New York. Of course you have never met
a Rexanian, excepting your lodge-keeper,
Rudolph?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I have,” cried Kate, who did
not fully realize that her accident had rendered
her slightly feverish and therefore
somewhat more loquacious than usual. “A
Rexanian dined at our house in the city a few
nights ago. He had come over on the steamer
with my father and mother. He was a very
charming man.”</p>

<p>There was something in her voice that impressed
Benedict as peculiar.</p>

<p>“One of the Rexanian nobility, of course?”
he asked, diplomatically.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, with some hesitation.
“He was a count—Count Szalaki.” Her face
flushed as the thought flashed through her
mind that her frankness in the presence of a
newspaper reporter was, to say the least of
it, indiscreet. But there were many influences
at work to render Kate Strong less
reticent than she ordinarily was by habit and
temperament. The sudden disappearance of
their Rexanian guest and the shadow that
had been cast upon his memory by her family
had made her impatient to clear up the
mystery that surrounded the only man who
had ever fully satisfied the romantic longings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
that pertained to her youth and her self-centred
nature.</p>

<p>That Ned Strong was fitted neither by temperament
nor by experience to solve a problem
that grew more and more inexplicable
as time passed, his sister well knew. Already
he had lost interest in a mystery that
grew more important to Kate the longer it
remained unsolved. She herself was powerless
to prosecute a line of inquiry that, she
felt sure, would, if carried forward to the
end, exonerate the Rexanian whose melancholy
and fascinating face had impressed her
as that of a man whose soul was too lofty for
subterfuge and fraud.</p>

<p>Fate had thrown her into the enforced
companionship of a man whose journalistic
training had thoroughly fitted him for solving
mysteries of the kind that now weighed
upon her overwrought mind. Conflicting
emotions warred within her. She possessed
many of the prejudices and all the self-control
that pertain to the real patrician; added
to these was a maidenly fear that somebody
might discover the secret that agitated her
heart—a secret that she hardly dared to whisper
to herself. On the other hand, she had
grown almost desperate in her anxiety to
learn something more of Count Szalaki, to
receive an explanation of his seemingly churlish
silence that would vindicate her innermost
conviction that he was what her fancy
painted him. Perhaps under other circumstances
her natural disinclination to grow
too confidential with a man about whom she
knew almost nothing would have prevailed,
but the reaction following her accident had
rendered her will-power less active than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
usual and her inclination to give way to an
impulse stronger.</p>

<p>“Count Szalaki!” exclaimed Norman Benedict,
musingly. Suddenly an expression of
eagerness crossed his face. “His name was
on the passenger list of one of the incoming
steamers recently. I noticed it at the time.
And so he is a Rexanian! That is very interesting.
You were kind enough to say a
moment ago, Miss Strong, that you owe me
a debt of gratitude. That is hardly true, for
what I have done for you has been a pleasure
to me. But, frankly, you can do me a kindness.
I should very much like to meet Count
Szalaki.”</p>

<p>A mournful expression rested on Kate
Strong’s face.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” she said regretfully, “but I
cannot gratify your wish. We—we—don’t
know where Count Szalaki is.”</p>

<p>Norman Benedict sprang up in excitement.
There was something in the girl’s face and
voice that revived the nervous tremor that
had affected him when the tremendous possibilities
of the hints thrown out by Ludovics
had first seriously impressed him.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me,” he asked, eagerly,
“that Count Szalaki has disappeared?”</p>

<p>“We have seen and heard nothing of him
since the night he dined with us,” answered
Kate.</p>

<p>The reporter paced up and down the room
impatiently.</p>

<p>“What do you know about him?” he cried,
at length. “Are you sure, Miss Strong, that—that
his title was genuine?”</p>

<p>Kate had found the reporter’s excitement
contagious, and she did not notice the bald<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
discourtesy of his question. Her desire to
gain Benedict as an ally in her efforts to re-establish
the reputation of her father’s guest
had become irresistible.</p>

<p>“We know,” she admitted, “that there is
no such title as that of Count Szalaki in Rexania.”</p>

<p>Norman Benedict stood still and looked
down at her with an expression of eager interest
on his face for which she could not
satisfactorily account.</p>

<p>At that moment the carriage in which Rudolph
had gone on his futile mission in
search of a physician rattled up to the gate,
and before the reporter could put further
questions to Kate the lodge-keeper had entered
the room.</p>

<p>“The doctor will be here directly, Miss
Strong,” said Rudolph, nervously. “Shall I
dismiss the carriage?”</p>

<p>“Let the carriage wait,” answered Norman
Benedict, harshly. Striding up to the pale-faced
Rexanian, he said, in a stern voice:</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear in Rexania, man, of a
certain Count Szalaki?”</p>

<p>It was, in a sense, a random shot, but it
struck home. Rudolph’s face looked like a
mask of bluish-white paste in the twilight
gloom of the darkening chamber. He put
up his hand, as if to ward off a blow. Kate
Strong strained her eyes to catch the changing
expression on the Rexanian’s countenance.
A deep silence fell upon the trio.
Suddenly the answer came to the reporter’s
question, but not from Rudolph Smolenski.</p>

<p>Muffled by distance, but unmistakable in
its horrid import, there echoed from the
manor-house the ugly crash of a pistol-shot.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

</div>

<p>Mrs. Brevoort and Ned Strong had found,
upon inquiry at the club-house, that Kate
had not been seen since she had wheeled
away with them. They stood at a corner
of the piazza and held council with each
other.</p>

<p>“How careless you have been, Mr. Strong!”
Mrs. Brevoort was saying, chidingly. “It is
well that you have decided never to marry.
How can a man who loses track of a sister
hope to keep his eye on a wife?”</p>

<p>“You are exacting,” he returned. “Why
should I expect to perform miracles? I am not
possessed of second-sight, nor of eyes in the
back of my head. But, Mrs. Brevoort, it is
a condition, not a theory, that confronts us,
as a famous man once said. Now, if you are
tired of wheeling, won’t you walk over to
our old house with me? Kate did not come
down the hill, you remember. I am inclined
to think that something may have happened
to her wheel, and that she stopped to have
Rudolph, our lodge-keeper, repair it. It is
not much of a walk, by a short cut I know
how to make.”</p>

<p>“I think, Mr. Strong,” answered Mrs. Brevoort,
“that you had better go alone. It is
getting late, and I must dress at once.”</p>

<p>“A woman’s eternal excuse for unsociability!”
cried the youth petulantly. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
he grew beseeching. “I ask so few favors
of you, Mrs. Brevoort,” he pleaded. “And,
remember, Kate may have met with an accident.
She would feel very lonely in that old
lodge if I had to go for a doctor. I appeal
unselfishly to you, Mrs. Brevoort. Walk over
to the lodge with me. Please do!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brevoort gazed at the blue waters of
the Sound musingly. She was not anxious
to bring a problem that must soon be solved
to an issue at once. But she was really worried
about Kate Strong and impatient to
learn what had befallen her best friend.
Furthermore, she knew that the short cut to
the manor-house was not a lover’s lane, in
that the path for the most part demanded the
single-file formation. Her hesitation, therefore,
was short-lived, and she was soon hurrying
away from the club-house, with Ned
Strong, in a gay mood, striding along at her
side.</p>

<p>“I cannot understand, Mr. Strong,” she remarked
severely, after they had left the
main road and were following the narrow
path that led toward the rear of the manor-house,
“I cannot understand how you can be
so light-hearted under these depressing circumstances.”</p>

<p>“The fact is, Mrs. Brevoort,” explained
Ned, “that I am not greatly worried about
Kate; and as for myself, I was never more
contented in my life.”</p>

<p>He glanced back at Mrs. Brevoort merrily.</p>

<p>“And you will be late for dinner, too,” exclaimed
his companion. “Surely you are one
man among many thousands, Mr. Strong, to
grow jolly with such a dismal fate staring you
in the face.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>The youth laughed aloud. Then he half-turned
around, and said, impressively:</p>

<p>“I eat nothing in these joyous days, Mrs.
Brevoort. Food has not passed my lips for
a week. I live on air, I walk on air, I am
an airy nothing with a local habitation and
a name. Speaking of that name, Mrs.
Brevoort——”</p>

<p>“But we weren’t speaking of that name,”
cried the little <i lang="fr">mondaine</i>, emphatically. “You
were talking about the ethereal nature of your
favorite food. I am sorry to say that I require
something more substantial than country
air to satisfy my appetite. You will observe,
Mr. Strong, that this is a veiled hint
intended to make you increase your pace. At
the rate at which you are now walking, it
will be scandalously late before we get anything
to eat.”</p>

<p>“Alas,” cried Ned, in assumed despair,
“how little encouragement a man gets to
cultivate the poetic side of his nature in these
days! Just look at this scene before us,” he
continued, turning as they reached the top
of a knoll that gave them a view of the Sound
and of the rear balcony of the manor-house.
They stood in silence for a time, watching
the changing tints that the early evening
scattered with prodigality across the surface
of the land-locked sea. Over toward the
Long Island shore a brilliantly lighted steamboat,
a great hotel escaping by water toward
the east, threw its merry gleam across the
waves.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ned Strong laid his hand excitedly
on his companion’s arm.</p>

<p>“Look,” he whispered, pointing to the balcony
of the manor-house. “What is that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>A small dark figure could be seen creeping
toward one of the windows that opened on
the balcony.</p>

<p>“There is a light inside the room,” exclaimed
Ned, almost trembling with excitement.
At that instant the dark form arose
from its recumbent attitude and stood in bold
relief against the window. On the instant
there came the crash of breaking glass, then
silence.</p>

<p>“He’s a burglar!” exclaimed Mrs. Brevoort,
her voice shaking perceptibly. Somehow,
she did not notice that Ned Strong’s
arm had been thrown around her protectingly.</p>

<p>At that moment the sharp, evil crack of a
pistol startled the night air.</p>

<p>“A burglar or a murderer,” muttered Ned
Strong, awe-struck. “Come,” he cried, almost
carrying his companion forward in his
excitement. “Come, we must get to the
lodge at once and find Rudolph! Come!
Quick!”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX.</h3>

</div>

<p>Rudolph Smolenski had relieved the intense
gloom that had settled over his inhospitable
drawing-room by lighting two oil
lamps and several candles, much to the satisfaction
of his unwelcome guests. The pistol-shot
that had emphasized their proximity
to crime had for an instant seemed to nail
down the curtain of night at one blow. Rudolph’s
activity in making the apartment
more cheerful had greatly tended to relieve
the strain of the situation.</p>

<p>“I am in a quandary,” Benedict had said
to Kate. “I hesitate to leave you here at
this moment, but there is a great mystery to
be solved at once.”</p>

<p>Rudolph’s hand trembled perceptibly as he
held a match to a candle’s wick. There was
something in his manner that affected Kate
Strong unpleasantly. Her overwrought
nerves exaggerated the uncanny features of
her surroundings, and she grew cold at the
thought of Benedict’s departure.</p>

<p>At that instant a door opened at the rear
of the lodge, and Mrs. Brevoort and Ned
Strong, groping through a dark hall-way
toward a gleam of light, burst into the room.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Kate?” cried Mrs.
Brevoort, rushing toward her friend, while
her companion stood in the centre of the
room, scrutinizing, with a puzzled expression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
in his eyes, the disturbed faces of Benedict
and Rudolph.</p>

<p>“Rudolph,” cried Ned Strong, suppressed
excitement in his voice, “a crime has been
committed at the house—perhaps a murder.
What do you know about it?”</p>

<p>Norman Benedict had been relieved of all
responsibility, so far as Kate Strong was concerned.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” he said to Ned Strong, “but
would it not be well for us to go up to the
manor-house at once?” Benedict did not lack
courage, but, under the circumstances, he
was pleased at the prospect of having an ally
in his tour of investigation.</p>

<p>Rudolph Smolenski, pale with apprehension,
but rendered active by the dark possibilities
that threatened him, had placed himself
at the doorway through which the young
men threatened to pass. The Rexanian put
up a hand with a gesture that was both
threatening and imploring.</p>

<p>“Remain here, Mr. Strong; and you, sir.
It may not be safe for you to go up to the
house.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Rudolph?” asked Ned
Strong, sternly. “Be careful, man. You
are putting yourself in a very questionable
position. Stand aside, and let us pass. If
there’s any one in great danger, Rudolph, I
think you’re the man. Stand aside.”</p>

<p>Kate Strong and Mrs. Brevoort, with hand
clasped in hand, were seated side by side on
the sofa, gazing with disturbed faces at the
three men.</p>

<p>“Listen to Rudolph, Ned,” implored Kate.
“He may be right. You may run a great
risk in going to the house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>Rudolph still stubbornly held his place in
front of the door. Norman Benedict’s patience
was at an end.</p>

<p>“Come, come, man,” he exclaimed. “Out
of the way, or we’ll be obliged to use force.
Do you hear me?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brevoort had arisen. Ned Strong felt
a gentle hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“Don’t go up to that gloomy old house,
Mr. Strong,” she implored, looking up at him
with an expression on her face that made
life seem very precious to him at that moment.</p>

<p>“There is not the slightest cause to worry,”
he said, quietly, although his pulse was beating
feverishly. “This gentleman—Mr.—Mr.——?”</p>

<p>“My name is Benedict,” answered the reporter,
impatiently. “I found Miss Strong
with a sprained ankle near the gate, and have
had the pleasure of being of service to her.
But you’ll pardon me for using heroic measures.
I have wasted too much time already.”</p>

<p>With these words, Benedict seized Rudolph
by the collar of his coat and hurled
the pudgy little Rexanian into a far corner
of the room. Then he bolted through the
door.</p>

<p>“I can’t let him go alone,” cried Ned
Strong, reluctantly but firmly removing Mrs.
Brevoort’s hand from his arm. “Remain
here. We’ll be back at once.”</p>

<p>Thus saying, he dashed down the dark corridor
in pursuit of Benedict.</p>

<p>Rudolph Smolenski had managed to totter
to his feet and was gazing about the room in
a dazed way. The reporter had, in the excitement
of the moment, used more force in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
removing the Rexanian from his path than
was actually necessary for his purpose.</p>

<p>“What do you make of all this, Kate?” exclaimed
Mrs. Brevoort, reseating herself beside
the girl, and looking at the ludicrous
picture that Rudolph presented, with a nervous
smile on her face.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I’ve got beyond the point where
my opinion is worth much,” answered Kate,
wearily. “My ankle aches, and the whole
universe seems to be nothing but an exposed
nerve.”</p>

<p>“Poor girl, how thoughtless I’ve been!”
cried Mrs. Brevoort, gently, pushing Kate
back into a reclining position. “Get me some
cold water, man,” she said to the lodge-keeper,
whose wits were beginning to return
to his aching head.</p>

<p>“That is much better,” said Kate gratefully,
a few moments later. “But is it not
strange that the doctor does not come?—Rudolph,
did you see Dr. Moore?”</p>

<p>“I did, Miss Strong,” answered the Rexanian,
with reckless defiance of the truth.
He had begun to feel that one lie more or
less would not make much difference with
the retribution that threatened to overtake
him so soon. “He should have been here
long before this.”</p>

<p>The minutes dragged slowly along. To
the two women the next quarter of an hour
seemed almost interminable. Mrs. Brevoort
used part of it to describe to Kate Strong the
weird scene that she and Ned had witnessed
just before the pistol-shot had punctuated the
course of events.</p>

<p>Morose, but alert, Rudolph Smolenski overheard
her story, and his sluggish brain began<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
to grasp the fact that it was high time for him
to act. Hitherto he had been tenacious of a
lingering hope that he had not already forfeited
his situation. The blow he had received
when he struck the floor had not
tended to give him a clear idea of the helplessness
of his position. But as it dawned
upon him that Ludovics must have been the
man who fired the pistol at the manor-house,
a cold sweat broke out upon his hands and
brow. He had been the last man to talk to
Ludovics, and the driver of the carriage that
still waited outside the lodge gate had been
a witness to their conversation. If Ludovics
had murdered the prince, he, Rudolph,
would be held as an accessory before the
fact.</p>

<p>“Where are you going, Rudolph?” asked
Kate suspiciously, as the Rexanian arose
and walked unsteadily toward the door leading
into the corridor.</p>

<p>“Just outside a moment, Miss Strong,” he
faltered. “I will take a look toward the big
house and see if they are coming.”</p>

<p>“Do,” returned Kate. “I am growing very
impatient,” she added, turning to Mrs. Brevoort.</p>

<p>They sat in silence for a time, their cold
hands pressed together.</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard the rattle of a ramshackle
vehicle as it passed the front of the
house, bound cityward.</p>

<p>“That’s strange,” cried Mrs. Brevoort,
springing up. “What does it mean?”</p>

<p>It meant that they would never set eyes
upon Rudolph Smolenski again. But they
had no time now to dwell upon his disappearance.
Hardly had the noise of the retreating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
carriage died away when the sound
of many voices reached them from the end of
the corridor, and they felt a mingled sensation
of relief and apprehension at the approaching
footsteps of a crowd.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

</div>

<p>Prince Carlo was seated at a small,
round, mahogany table in the centre of his
shadow-haunted room. Before him lay a
not uninviting repast. Cold meat, cut-up
peaches, bread, butter, iced coffee, and a
dish containing a kind of pickle known only
to Rexanians strove in vain to tempt his appetite.
Rukacs had spread the table silently,
but with an air of deference that was grateful
to the captive prince. No word had been
spoken between them, but in his very silence
Rukacs seemed to do homage to the youth’s
rank, a rank that the conspirator recognized
in practice while in theory he denied its existence.</p>

<p>Evolution has not yet placed man so far
above the lower order of animals that he
does not in his heart of hearts acknowledge
the tendency of nature to ratify the monarchical
idea. He finds beneath him in the
scale of being the bees setting up a queen
and the herds of wild cattle paying homage
to a king bull. He discovers that the prevailing
conception of a future world, even
among democrats, pictures God upon His
throne, surrounded by celestial courtiers.
Whether he looks up or down, therefore,
man’s eye rests upon the concrete manifestations
of the abstract idea of royalty, and,
sweeping the whole range of existence, he
sees a throne beneath his feet and dreams of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
another somewhere beyond the stars. The
old cry, “<i lang="fr">Le roi est mort, vive le roi</i>,” may
have in it the germs of universal truth that a
nation of freemen would do well to heed.
The substitution of a political “boss” for an
hereditary ruler may be a step forward, but
there are those to whom it looks like reaction
illustrating the very nature of things.</p>

<p>Prince Carlo of Rexania sipped his coffee
and pondered certain questions related to the
propositions just laid down. Whatever of
weakness there had been in the voluptuous
dreams that had tempted him from the stern
path of duty in the afternoon had disappeared,
and his mind now dwelt wholly upon
the obligations he owed to his people, his forefathers,
and himself. As the thought of his
physical helplessness at that moment stung
him into a gesture of angry impatience, Rukacs
crossed the room and closed the window
that looked out upon the balcony, the window
that Prince Carlo had vainly attempted to
open on the night of his arrival. Rukacs understood
the secret of its fastenings, and silently,
almost stealthily, took an unnecessary
precaution against his captive’s escape. The
manner in which the Rexanian performed
this task proved that he was, at bottom,
ashamed of the <i lang="fr">rôle</i> he was playing at the
moment.</p>

<p>“If you desire anything, your—your royal
highness,” he faltered, as he recrossed the
room and placed a hand upon the door opening
into the hall, “will you kindly rap three
times upon the floor?” The conspirator’s
flushed face bore outward evidence of his
interior agitation. Rukacs loved freedom
too well to make a graceful jailer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>Prince Carlo bowed in acknowledgment of
his captor’s words, and on the instant found
himself alone, the grating sound of a rusty
key again serving to emphasize the chilling
fact that he, the heir-apparent to the throne
of Rexania, was a prisoner in a land whose
political stock in trade is liberty.</p>

<p>There was something oppressive in the
sudden silence. Prince Carlo glanced furtively
around the room. He had become
used to the depressing characteristics of the
apartment, and the antic shadows that lurked
in the far corners and hovered around the
curtains of the bed no longer affected his
nerves. But at this moment the uncanny
spirit of the old house seemed to whisper to
him in threatening tones. His overwrought
fancy pictured the stealthy assassin creeping
through the damp corridors and dodging behind
crumbling curtains in his search for
blood. A door creaked on its hinges in some
distant corner of the house; he started as
though the sound carried with it a menace he
must heed.</p>

<p>Presently the reaction came, and a smile
of self-pity played about his clean-cut mouth.
With an impatient gesture, he brushed his
damp hair back from his brow and poured
some of the iced coffee into a glass. He was
about to raise the draught to his lips, when
the conviction seized him that somebody’s
eyes were resting upon him. A shiver went
through his frame, and he replaced the goblet
upon the table with trembling hand.
Courageous though Prince Carlo was by nature,
there was a weird, uncanny influence
at work, as it seemed to him, to disturb the
balance of his nervous system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>Annoyed at himself, the youth arose from
the table, and, resting one hand upon the
coverlet, glanced toward the window. On
the instant his eyes met the burning gaze of
Ludovics, who crouched outside the window,
enraged to find it locked. For a moment
neither the prince nor the madman moved.
Then, with one bound, the latter smashed
his way through the glass, and cut and bleeding,
a ghastly, crimson incarnation of all that
is hideous in the cult of the assassin, he faced
Prince Carlo across the table, while the
lamp flickered threateningly as the night
breeze swept through the window into the
room.</p>

<p>The two men stood motionless, gazing into
each other’s eyes. The blood-stained madman,
representative of all that is most horrible
in the effort of man to escape from the
tyranny of tradition and to seek higher
things, faced the incarnation of reaction, the
embodiment of obsolete prerogatives and
time-dishonored claims. The man who was
in the right was mad; he who was in the
wrong was sane. Thus did they represent,
as they stood facing each other in the dim
light of that wind-beset chamber, ages of
human history.</p>

<p>The glare in Ludovics’ eyes faded slowly
as he looked upon the pale, strong, beautiful
face of the youth who had assumed in his
wild fancy the figure of a tyrant who held
wild revelry at the expense of the people in
a palace here at hand. What gleam of reason
returned to his crazy mind, who shall say?
There was no bacchanalian carnival surrounding
the prince; only a simple supper, untasted,
spread before him. He was not mocking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
Ludovics, but only looking at him with
sad, splendid eyes that stirred the distraught
soul of the madman to its depths.
Beneath their gaze Ludovics seemed to collapse
and slink away. He turned, with a
low cry, that echoed through the room like
the wail of a spirit damned, and stumbled
towards the window.</p>

<p>Prince Carlo stood motionless at the table,
watching the retreating form of the madman.
Suddenly Ludovics drew himself erect and
turned again to face the prince. Raising his
pistol slowly until the muzzle rested against
his forehead, Ludovics said, in voice so calm
that it seemed to come from a man whose
mind was absolutely normal:</p>

<p>“Your majesty, I salute you. Accept my
homage.”</p>

<p>On the instant he pulled the trigger and
sent a bullet crashing through his crazy
brain.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

</div>

<p>Prince Carlo’s face was pale and drawn
and his eyes gleamed feverishly as he turned
from the ghastly sight in front of him and
gazed at the Rexanians who had thronged
upstairs and into the room. Their presence
was a relief to him at that moment.</p>

<p>Posadowski pushed forward through the
crowd of silent and awe-stricken men. Approaching
the prince, he said:</p>

<p>“Your royal highness, believe me, we did
not know that this man,” pointing to the
prostrate form of the suicide, “had left the
city.”</p>

<p>Prince Carlo turned toward the group,
whose white faces in the flickering light
thrown out by the wind-pestered lamp seemed
to haunt the room like ghosts. The youth’s
countenance was stern and menacing. He
had held up a hand and haughtily enforced
silence upon the cowed conspirators.</p>

<p>“You know not, my countrymen,” said
Prince Carlo, in a low, penetrating voice,
and speaking in the Rexanian tongue, “how
deep is the grief that stirs my soul. Yonder
madman sought my life. His murderous
hand was turned against himself. Who shall
say what power it was that intervened to
save me from his wrath? Do you call it
chance? If such it was, there is no God.
But in my heart of hearts I know that in this
room we see the impress of a mighty hand.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
The fiat of the King of kings has been
obeyed. You plot to thwart His will. As
well attempt to wound the stars with stones!
You hold me here a prisoner. You think,
blind, feeble children, that you can mould a
nation’s destiny, can dictate to the Omnipotent
the future of a race: look upon the
bloody form of that unhappy man and learn
the lesson that God reigns. Listen! There
is a voice that tells me that I must mount my
father’s throne. It tells me that in the universal
plan that makes for higher things the
part that I must take lies far from hence. I
am no tyrant: I do not crave the awful
power that he who wields a sceptre may
usurp. My countrymen, I will be frank with
you. To live in peace in this fair land, to
lose my name and all the burdens that it
bears, to forget that on my shoulders the
welfare of a nation rests—ah, this were
sweet. But a sterner fate is mine. I must
go back to the land we love so well. I must
some day take up the weary task that falls
from my father’s tired hands. I must sacrifice
all things that most men love to the long
service of a people not yet fitted for self-government.
Think you that this is selfishness?
I tell you that, if my love of country
and of duty were not greater than my love
of self, no power on earth could force me
back to Rexania—to the land that offers me
a throne upon which no man can sit to-day
in peace. A crown? A crown of thorns
awaits me. Power? Only so long as it is
used in the service of God and my people.
Homage? The only homage that makes glad
the heart of kings comes from those who
praise the man rather than the monarch.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
Think not, my countrymen, that I am pleading
to you for freedom. Whether you grant
it or withhold it now, it is sure to come.
But when I am gone you will reflect that I
go not to a bed of roses, but to a couch made
of iron, around which mighty shadows lurk.
Pardon me for so long detaining you, but
remember me in the days to come as one who
forgives you in your errors, and who bears
you no ill-will.”</p>

<p>While the prince had been speaking, two
men had joined the group at the doorway,
Ned Strong and Norman Benedict. They
gazed with amazement on the scene before
them. Pushing his way through the yielding
throng, Ned Strong stood before the prince.</p>

<p>“Count Szalaki,” he exclaimed, extending
his hand, “this is the last place on earth in
which I had expected to find you. But, as
your host, I give you welcome.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Strong!” cried Prince Carlo, in astonishment:
“I do not understand. You say I
am your guest?”</p>

<p>Ned Strong smiled grimly as he cast his
eyes over the group of startled Rexanians.</p>

<p>“I fear,” he sad, sarcastically, “that my
welcome cannot include so large a party. I
suppose,” he went on, addressing Posadowski,
who had not slunk back into the throng,
“I suppose that Rudolph Smolenski is responsible
for your presence here?”</p>

<p>The arch-conspirator bowed sullenly.</p>

<p>“And who is this man, my guest—Count
Szalaki?” asked Strong, sternly.</p>

<p>“He is the Crown Prince Carlo, heir-apparent
to the throne of Rexania,” answered
Posadowski, a note of triumph in his voice.</p>

<p>Ned Strong turned and met the large, sad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
eyes of the youth who had been relegated in
his mind to that <i lang="la">terra incognita</i> where frauds
and adventurers lurk and plot. The blood
rushed to his face as he realized that his recent
words of welcome had been tipped with
sarcasm wrought by suspicion.</p>

<p>“Permit me to explain, Mr. Strong,” remarked
Prince Carlo, quietly, while Norman
Benedict, glancing excitedly at his watch,
pushed forward toward the central group.
“These men are dreamers. Less mad than
yonder suicide, whose death shall serve them
for a warning and a sign, they plot to change
the laws of God and man. How they learned
my secret matters not. All that is essential
now is that a power greater than earth holds
has rendered vain their plots and schemes
and crimes. Let them reflect upon the mystery
that surrounds the ways of God. They
brought me to this house. Behold, I find
myself the guest of the one man in many
millions I have cause to call my friend! One
of their brethren breaks through yonder window,
bent upon my death. As I stand erect
before him, the bullet that was meant for me
goes crashing through his brain! Oh, blind
and foolish children, learn that there are
mysteries ye cannot solve. Plot no longer
to change the fate of the country you have
wronged, a country that found you faithless
years ago and drove you from her heart.
You love Rexania? Then show your love by
leaving to her loyal sons her future and the
future of my house. No man can serve two
masters. Faithful to the land of your adoption,
you cannot also be of service to Rexania.
Abandon your plots and stratagems,
and abide by the lesson of this night’s work.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
Farewell.—Mr. Strong, I am at your service.”</p>

<p>Prince Carlo turned abruptly from his
countrymen and placed his hand upon Ned
Strong’s arm. The latter looked about him
for Norman Benedict, but the reporter had
disappeared.</p>

<p>“Prince Carlo,” said Ned Strong, “I will
take you to the lodge, where my sister will
be very glad to renew her acquaintance with
you.”</p>

<p>“Miss Strong is here?” exclaimed the
prince, eagerly. “Indeed, the Fates are
kind to me to-night.” A smile of delight
played over his pale, drawn face.</p>

<p>“Will you wait here until I return?” asked
Ned Strong of Posadowski. “There are several
matters about which I must consult
you.” He made a gesture toward a black
shadow in a corner near the window.</p>

<p>“I will stay here with two or three of
my men,” answered the arch-conspirator
deferentially. “We are truly anxious, Mr.
Strong, to save you from all further annoyance.”</p>

<p>As Prince Carlo and Ned Strong crossed
the lawn and made toward the lodge, they
found themselves followed by several Rexanians,
who clung close to them but maintained
a respectful silence. Suddenly Ned
Strong turned and faced them.</p>

<p>“What will you have?” he asked, angrily.
“Is it not enough that you have been kidnappers
and housebreakers, without becoming
permanent nuisances?”</p>

<p>“Pardon us, Mr. Strong,” answered the gigantic
Posnovitch, deferentially; “we have
no wish to annoy you, but it is fitting that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
the Crown Prince of Rexania should have a
body-guard.”</p>

<p>Ned Strong placed his hand upon the arm
of his royal friend.</p>

<p>“Your countrymen, Prince Carlo,” he murmured,
“are strangely inconsistent. They
would crucify you at one moment and crown
you the next.”</p>

<p>“’Tis true, my friend,” returned the prince
sadly. “They illustrate the fickleness of the
human race both in its dealings with kings
and with God. But God reigns, and kings
still live.”</p>

<p>At this moment they entered the corridor
of the lodge and groped their way toward
the room in which Kate Strong and Mrs. Brevoort
listened apprehensively to the sounds
of approaching footsteps.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

</div>

<p>“Count Szalaki!”</p>

<p>To the men who heard Kate Strong utter
that name there was nothing but amazement
in her voice, but to the sympathetic ear of
Mrs. Brevoort there was that in her friend’s
outcry that was of more significance than
mere surprise.</p>

<p>Rudolph’s parlor presented at that instant
a picturesque appearance. At the doorway
leading into the corridor stood Prince Carlo
and Ned Strong, while in the dim light behind
them could be seen the grim faces of
several Rexanians. Kate Strong, her cheeks
pale from the nervous strain of recent events,
but with eyes that gleamed with delight at
this moment, was seated on the sofa, facing
the doorway, while Mrs. Brevoort stood by
her side, her hand resting on the girl’s shoulder.</p>

<p>The Rexanian prince crossed the room hurriedly,
and, bending down with infinite grace,
kissed Kate’s upraised hand.</p>

<p>“Your brother told me you were here,” he
said, and added, with convincing simplicity,
“His words made me very happy.”</p>

<p>Ned Strong had approached the little
group.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Brevoort,” he said, with great solemnity,
“permit me to present to you”—here he
glanced at Kate for an instant—“permit me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
to present to you the Crown Prince Carlo of
Rexania.”</p>

<p>A tinge of red appeared in the royal
youth’s pale cheeks as he gracefully acknowledged
Ned’s words of introduction.
Amazement, perhaps dismay, was written
on Kate Strong’s face. She was looking up
at the Rexanian questioningly.</p>

<p>“You are a long way from home, your
royal highness,” exclaimed Mrs. Brevoort, a
mischievous gleam in her eyes. “But I am
pleased to see you again.”</p>

<p>“We have met before, then?” inquired the
prince, a puzzled look on his face.</p>

<p>“No, but I have not forgotten your face.
I saw you at the head of your troops in Rexopolis,
two years ago. I did not then imagine
that I should ever meet you in such a
place as this.”</p>

<p>“The unhappy chance that brought me
here has, I assure you, its compensation,”
returned the prince, smilingly, as he turned
and looked down into the troubled face of
Kate Strong.</p>

<p>“Sit down here by me,” said the girl, to
whom conflicting emotions had come as an
antidote to physical pain. She had almost
forgotten that her sprained ankle was aching
stubbornly. “I want you to tell me what has
happened to you since we last met. You owe
me an apology, you know. But wait; I had
almost forgotten. Are you really the crown
prince? Then, of course, I have no right to
ask for an explanation. The king can do no
wrong, I believe.”</p>

<p>Prince Carlo seated himself by her side,
while a sad smile crossed his pale face.</p>

<p>“How out of place the old ideas appear!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
he exclaimed. “But, frankly, it has been a
heavy cross to me, Miss Strong, to feel that
you might wonder at my lack of courtesy.
But I have been a helpless prisoner in the
hands of yonder men.”</p>

<p>Kate looked at him wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Prince Carlo,” she said, in a low
voice, “tell me, what did they wish with
you?”</p>

<p>Prince Carlo glanced searchingly around
the room before replying. Mrs. Brevoort
and Ned Strong were standing near the doorway,
talking to the Rexanians who had appointed
themselves a body-guard to their
recent prisoner.</p>

<p>“They would have me,” he answered
gloomily, “betray my trust and leave my
country to chaos and despair.”</p>

<p>Her eyes sought his, but he failed to meet
her gaze.</p>

<p>“And you—you will go back to Rexania?”
she asked falteringly.</p>

<p>“It is imperative,” he answered, knowing
that her eyes were upon his face, but keeping
his gaze fixed on the shadows that lurked
in the corners of the room. “Already it may
be too late for me to undo the damage these
men have wrought. What has happened in
Rexopolis I do not know, but I dread to learn
the truth.” He turned and looked down into
her face. She smiled up at him sadly.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry for you,” she whispered.
What she meant by the words she hardly
knew. The world seemed topsy-turvy to her
fevered mind. Her life, usually so uneventful,
had been filled this day with startling
events, and she was worn with physical pain
and the turmoil of conflicting emotions.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
She wondered vaguely that she had not been
more surprised to learn that the heir-apparent
to a European throne had been a
prisoner in the house where she was born.
She realized with annoyance that her mind
refused to confine itself to the bare facts presented
to it, but showed an inclination to
make short journeys into the realms of
dreams and fancies.</p>

<p>Prince Carlo was gazing into her eyes
earnestly.</p>

<p>“Your sympathy is very sweet to me,” he
said, in a voice that was vibrant with suppressed
longing. “How much it means to
me—may I tell you?”</p>

<p>His voice had sunk to a whisper.</p>

<p>“If you wish,” she murmured, her lips
trembling as she spoke.</p>

<p>“It means,” he went on firmly, “a glimpse
of a paradise I may never seek. It means
that I look at the fairest sight on earth
through the bars of an iron cage. It means
that I will treasure in my heart, through all
the dark, grim years that call to me, a memory
that shall be to me the brightest gem of
life. It means, Miss Strong, that I, a king,
am more blessed by those dear words you
spoke than by all the tawdry glory of my
throne and crown.”</p>

<p>He was silent, and the girl placed a cold
hand in his for an instant and then withdrew
it quickly.</p>

<p>“We have taken the liberty, your royal
highness,” said Mrs. Brevoort breezily, as
she and Ned Strong crossed the room, “of
sending one of your attendants to New Rochelle
for a carriage. It seems that Rudolph,”
she continued, glancing at Kate,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
“has made his escape in the vehicle that
waited outside. And now we are anxious
to discover if your lodge-keeper left anything
to eat in the house. It is absolutely
necessary that we fortify ourselves in some
way for the ride before us.”</p>

<p>The crown prince had arisen and beckoned
to the towering Posnovitch, who blocked the
doorway.</p>

<p>“Go up to the house, man, and tell Posadowski
to send us whatever he has to eat and
drink. I believe,” he continued, smiling at
Mrs. Brevoort, “that we are not in imminent
danger of starving to death.”</p>

<p>“And may I repay your present hospitality,
your royal highness,” cried Mrs. Brevoort
gayly, “by numbering you among my guests
at dinner to-morrow?”</p>

<p>Prince Carlo glanced furtively at the averted
face of Kate Strong, as he said, in a voice
in marked contrast to the sprightly tones in
which the invitation had been extended to
him:</p>

<p>“I am very sorry, Mrs. Brevoort, to be
obliged to decline your hospitality, but—but
I shall sail for Europe early to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

</div>

<p>Half an hour later a carriage drew up at
the lodge gate. A cold supper, of which
Mrs. Brevoort and Ned Strong had partaken
with forced gayety, had vindicated Prince
Carlo’s assertion that the danger of immediate
starvation had never been imminent.
But the sound of carriage-wheels came as a
great relief to them all, for the gloomy features
of their environment had been emphasized
as time passed by. Ned Strong had
held a whispered consultation in the corridor
with Posadowski, who had come down from
the manor-house for instructions, and the
train of thought suggested by his visit had
not tended to decrease the melancholy nature
of their surroundings.</p>

<p>As the carriage rolled away from the lodge
entrance, with Mrs. Brevoort and Ned Strong
facing Kate and Prince Carlo, who occupied
the back seat, a simultaneous sigh of relief
broke from the quartette.</p>

<p>“This is a new sensation,” whispered Mrs.
Brevoort to Ned Strong. “Breaking jail
with a captive prince! Is it not delightful?”</p>

<p>“Which is the captive prince?” returned
Ned, bending down to get a better view of
her face.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” she answered. “I was about
to say that nobody fully appreciates freedom
until he has spent a certain amount of time
in captivity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>Her remark silenced the youth for a moment.
The longer he weighed it, the more
discouraging did it seem to him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he suggested, “there may be
a vast difference in jailers.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but you beg the question,” exclaimed
Mrs. Brevoort argumentatively.</p>

<p>“I fear,” he put in, hastily, “that that is
all I have the courage to do with it. There
is always safety in begging a question. Such
a course at least defers the day of doom.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brevoort laughed outright, and looked
up at Ned Strong mockingly.</p>

<p>“Are you threatened with a day of doom,
Mr. Strong?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he answered mournfully. Then
he exclaimed, with cheerfulness, “At all
events, it is to be preceded by an evening
of perfect bliss.” She drew a bit closer to
him at the words, as if to emphasize their
truth.</p>

<p>The carriage, rolling noisily toward the
city, contained at that moment a condensed
illustration of the curious vagaries that pertain
to human affairs. Cupid was perched
upon the box beside the driver, and chuckled
mischievously to himself as he realized what
was going on within the vehicle. Well he
knew, the little rascal, that two of his victims
looked into the future with hope and
joy. The other arrows that he had used had
made wounds for which time could promise
no relief. But it is in such contrasts as these
that Cupid finds the pleasure of his impish
life. The humdrum contentment that would
have made the quartette less romantic but
more evenly blessed would have bored Cupid
with the crowd. He would have placed a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
substitute upon the box, and have flown
away, to continue his sport with deluded
human hearts, where he could see his victims
wince beneath his shafts.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said Prince Carlo, “why you
are so silent. Are you in great pain?” His
voice had in it a caressing note as he whispered
to Kate Strong and tried to look into
her downcast face.</p>

<p>“I hardly know,” she answered wearily.
“I feel very tired.”</p>

<p>What had been to the prince a shadowy
temptation, painting day-dreams before his
eyes, as he gazed that afternoon on the sun-kissed
waters of the Sound, had taken to
itself a concrete form. Here beside him was
the one woman in all the world for whom he
would willingly renounce all the glittering
but unsubstantial glory of his kingship. He
had said, on the impulse of the moment, that
he would go back to the troubled land to
which his duty called him; but his heart rebelled
against his avowed purpose as he held
Kate Strong’s cold hand for a moment in his
as the carriage rumbled onward toward the
beckoning lights of the great city. The girl
withdrew her hand. He did not know how
great an effort it had cost her to repress a
sob.</p>

<p>Presently Kate looked up at him, her eyes
bright with the emotion she controlled.</p>

<p>“In Rexopolis,” she said, “there is great
disorder. The newspapers this morning
printed long accounts of what they called a
crisis at your capital.”</p>

<p>Prince Carlo was silent for a moment. His
worst forebodings seemed about to be realized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>“And what of my father?” he asked, at
length, his voice trembling perceptibly.</p>

<p>“He is very ill,” she answered. Suddenly
he felt her hand in his again.</p>

<p>“And the people grow restless? Tell me,
is it so?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered.</p>

<p>“And the wonder grows that I, the crown
prince, do not show myself?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>They sat speechless for a time, hand
clasped in hand. The sympathy of this
woman was very sweet to the self-exiled
prince at this dark crisis in his life.</p>

<p>“It is so hard,” he murmured. “Tell me,”
he whispered, hoarsely, bending close to her
and looking down into her pale, drawn face—“tell
me, Miss Strong, what must I do? I
tremble at the thoughts that fill my mind.
Tell me—for you must know what I would
say—what must I do?”</p>

<p>She was silent for an instant, and he knew
that she trembled with emotion. Then her
eyes sought his in the dim half-light, and
she said, firmly:</p>

<p>“There is no choice, Prince Carlo. You
would never be happy should you not go
back.”</p>

<p>“But why?” he argued. “To what do I go
back? Surely not to happiness?”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, sadly. “You go back
to—honor.”</p>

<p>“To honor,” he admitted, and then muttered,
“and to death.”</p>

<p>Her hand pressed his with feverish force.
“Death is better than——” She paused suddenly.</p>

<p>“Than what?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>“Death,” she said, firmly, “is better than
disgrace.”</p>

<p>Prince Carlo sank back in his seat, his face
white against the cushions.</p>

<p>“You speak the truth,” he murmured, restlessly.
“I really have no choice. To stay
here is dishonor, to return is death. God
help me!” His words sounded more like a
groan than like a prayer.</p>

<p>They had reached the stone pavements of
the city. The carriage jolted annoyingly
over the ill-laid streets.</p>

<p>Prince Carlo leaned down until his face
was close to Kate’s.</p>

<p>“You are a grand, a noble woman,” he
whispered. “Remember, dear, for all time
my heart is yours, and yours alone. Whatever
Fate may have in store for me, it cannot
deprive me of this one sweet thought. I love
you, my darling, I love you!”</p>

<p>Her hand was like ice in his, and she spoke
not, but he knew that she wept softly.</p>

<p>A moment later, the carriage drew up in
front of Gerald Strong’s house.</p>

<p>“Let me see you once more alone before I
go,” whispered Prince Carlo. “I have one
thing more to say to you.”</p>

<p>She pressed his hand in acquiescence. An
instant later, the driver opened the carriage
door, and Cupid with a mocking laugh flitted
from the box, rejoicing at the mischief he
had wrought.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

</div>

<p>Norman Benedict had reached the office
of the <cite>Trumpet</cite> in time to add a startling feature
to the ten o’clock “extra” of that enterprising
journal. A long cable despatch from
Rexopolis, announcing the death of King
Sergius III., the vain clamorings of the people
for the appearance of his successor, the
still popular Prince Carlo, and the certainty
of an immediate choice by the populace of a
provisional President, was of itself sufficient
to make the “extra” notable. But Benedict
had been enabled, by a combination of foresight
and good luck, to give the readers of
the <cite>Trumpet</cite> a startling explanation of Prince
Carlo’s absence from Rexopolis at this great
crisis. On the night upon which Prince
Carlo had lost a kingdom, Norman Benedict
had gained a promotion.</p>

<p>Gerald Strong and his wife had sat in their
library late that evening, wondering why
Ned and Kate had not returned, when the
butler brought in to them the late edition of
a newspaper whose startling head-lines
seemed to tremble with excitement. They
had barely finished reading the astounding
details of a pregnant international crisis,
when the arrival of the carriage that bore to
their door a dethroned king, a fatherless
youth, upon whose shoulders rested a great
burden demanding an heroic sacrifice, broke
in upon their conversation.</p>

<p>While the somewhat disjointed explanations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
of the truants were doing their utmost
to add to the confusion of Mrs. Strong’s
mind, her husband had taken Prince Carlo
by the hand, and, telling Ned to accompany
them, had led the guest he had known as
Count Szalaki into the library.</p>

<p>“I have read the whole story,” said the
banker, when they found themselves alone.
“You have suffered a great wrong, Prince
Carlo. You have my heartfelt sympathy.”</p>

<p>He took the young man’s hand, and continued,
very gently, “I have sad news for you.”</p>

<p>Prince Carlo gazed at him with eyes that
were full of agony.</p>

<p>“He is dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Gerald Strong. “He died
this afternoon.”</p>

<p>A change came over the face of the son of
kings. The dread certainty that confronted
him seemed to affect him like a call to arms.
He stood more erect, the lines around his
mouth grew firm, and his voice was cold and
hard, as he said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Strong, may I ask you to tell me all
that you have heard?”</p>

<p>“You will find the facts, as far as they are
known, in this despatch from Rexopolis.”</p>

<p>Prince Carlo took the newspaper and eagerly
perused the two columns outlining the
situation at his capital. While he was reading,
Ned Strong said to his father:</p>

<p>“How did you know, father, that Count
Szalaki was the crown prince?”</p>

<p>“The <cite>Trumpet</cite>, Ned, has a long account of
the occurrences that have made our manor-house
unpleasantly notorious.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” cried Ned. “Our friend Mr. Benedict
has been very energetic.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>“Furthermore,” continued Mr. Strong, “I
have several despatches to-day from our
representative in Vienna, who has been
clever enough to suspect that Count Szalaki
might be the Crown Prince Carlo.”</p>

<p>An exclamation of mingled astonishment
and anger broke from Prince Carlo at this
moment.</p>

<p>“Fejeravy!” he cried. “Fejeravy for President!
It is impossible! Traitor! Fejeravy,
whom we have trusted for years as our most
loyal subject! It is incredible!”</p>

<p>Prince Carlo sank into a chair wearily.
The treachery of the man who had been his
father’s closest adviser overwhelmed him for
a moment. Suddenly he looked up at his
host, his jaw firmly set and a gleam in his
eyes that proved that a new incentive had
come to him urging his return to his distracted
fatherland.</p>

<p>“There is a steamer leaving for Southampton
in the morning?” he asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Gerald Strong. Then he
seated himself beside the prince, and said,
gently:</p>

<p>“You will forgive me, Prince Carlo, if I
take the liberty of a much older man, not
well versed in the etiquette of courts, to ask
you if your return at such a crisis as the
present is not foolhardy?”</p>

<p>“Mayhap,” cried the prince, a note of recklessness
in his voice. “But think not that I
am friendless because a few of my people
have been tools in a traitor’s hands. A hundred
years ago the madmen of France informed
the world that kings and their God
were dead. Short-sighted, deluded dreamers!
They slew in the name of Freedom, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
brought forth—Napoleon. I shall go back,
not to bring peace, but a sword. Fools that
they are, to think that my people, loving
me, will listen forever to the voice of Fejeravy.—Fejeravy,
the Judas of my house!
It is not for naught that we who hold the
thrones of Europe are bound together by the
ties of blood. What madness blinds my people?
If I were dead, mayhap their crazy
scheme would have some hope of victory.
But behind me, as my allies, stand all the
kings and emperors of the world. At my
back are armies before which Rexania’s
rabble rout would fly like chaff. Mad as was
the scheme that sought to make me abdicate
my throne to please the wishes of a few adventurous
rebels in this New World that I
shall never see again, it was not more futile
than the effort of my people to set up for
themselves a government against which
every court in Europe will be arrayed.”</p>

<p>Prince Carlo arose and paced the room
restlessly. Gerald Strong and his son remained
silent. They seemed to be gazing
from a mountain-top upon some wild and
bloody scene in ancient history. To these
calm, unimpressionable Americans the future
that called to this pale-faced youth seemed
to be made of the warp and woof that form
the texture of the visions of the night. Of
what did he speak? Of an alien army under
his command, placing him upon a throne
stained with the blood of his own countrymen!
He represented the very incarnation of Reaction
calling with confidence upon its ancient
allies, Blood and Iron. And yet he was a gentle
youth. His smile was charming as he
took the hand of his silent host and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>“Forgive me for boring you with my selfish
thoughts. You have been very kind.
How much I thank you, I cannot say. And
now, time presses. I have much to do, in
small ways, before the steamer sails. May I
trouble you to ask Miss Kate if I may say
farewell?”</p>

<p>Ned Strong left the room and returned a
moment later.</p>

<p>“My sister will see you in the drawing-room,”
he said as he re-entered the library.
“And then, if you wish, I will place myself
at your service, Prince Carlo, until your departure.”</p>

<p>A moment later father and son were left
alone. They remained silent for several
minutes, attempting to readjust their wandering
thoughts to the quiet exigencies of
their own environment.</p>

<p>“I have another piece of news for you, father,”
said Ned, after a time.</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I am sure,” he explained, with an effort
at playfulness, “that Mr. Benedict has not
announced it in his ‘extra.’ Mrs. Brevoort
has promised to be my wife.”</p>

<p class="tb">Prince Carlo of Rexania stood for an instant,
white and trembling, upon the steps
that led from Gerald Strong’s doorway.
Upon his lips he still felt the kiss of a loving
and sorrow-stricken girl. The bell in a distant
church-steeple was striking midnight.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said, gently, placing a hand
upon Ned Strong’s arm,—“come, comrade,
I need a friend to-night; for the world seems
very sad.”</p>

<p class="titlepage">THE END.</p>

<div class="chapter">


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A PRINCESS OF THE RHINE.</h2>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.</h3>

</div>

<p>“Three aces! Your majesty is in luck!
Shall we make it a jack-pot?”</p>

<p>King Rudolph XII., of Hesse-Heilfels, solemnly
acquiesced in this suggestion by a nod
of his gray head. His small, greenish-gray
eyes gleamed with excitement, and the flush
on his heavily moulded face bore witness to
the wicked joy he was deriving from a new
game of chance. Rudolph was a true
Schwartzburger in his fondness for gambling.
There is a legend of the Rhine which
tells how one of Rudolph’s lineal ancestors,
who occupied the throne of Hesse-Heilfels
three centuries ago, lost his kingdom on a
throw of the dice and his honor by a thrust
of the sword. The courtier who had won a
kingdom from his liege lord did not live to
tell the tale of his good luck. The house of
Schwartzburger has never neglected heroic
measures when it has been confronted by a
great crisis. To gamble with a king of
Hesse-Heilfels has always required not only
skill but courage.</p>

<p>That Jonathan Edwards Bennett, a rolling
stone from Litchfield County, Connecticut,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
United States of America, had dared to teach
King Rudolph of Hesse-Heilfels the mysteries
of the American game of poker, spoke
well for the Yankee adventurer’s boldness.
One of the first stories that Bennett had been
told upon entering Rudolph’s kingdom had
turned upon the fate of a commercial traveller
from the United States who had managed
to penetrate to the sacred presence of
the testy monarch. The drummer had offered
to equip the army of Hesse-Heilfels with bicycles
at so low a figure that the suspicions
of King Rudolph had been aroused. Becoming
convinced by a series of searching questions
that the commercial traveller could
not fulfil the promises he had made, the
proud but irascible Schwartzburger confiscated
the Yankee’s watch and loose change.
He then gave orders that the stranger be
driven beyond the borders of the kingdom.
Rudolph XII. prided himself upon always being
just, though he might be at times severe.</p>

<p>King Rudolph of Hesse-Heilfels and Jonathan
Edwards Bennett of Connecticut played
poker amid luxurious and romantic surroundings.
The favorite castle of the Schwartzburgers
caps a hill overlooking the distant
Rhine, but somewhat out of the beaten line
of travel. The Schwartzburgers have always
cherished a dislike for tourists, and under
Rudolph XII. the little kingdom of Hesse-Heilfels
has been jealously guarded from the
prying eyes of fussy travellers, who, as His
Majesty had often remarked, were apt to
lead the good people of the country into
temptation. Four hundred years ago a
Schwartzburger who had been crowned king
of Hesse-Heilfels had said: “The divine right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
to fleece resides in the person of the king,
and when exercised by a subject becomes
treason.” One of the most learned professors
at the University of Heidelberg some years
ago wrote a treatise to prove that this remark
was, on the face of it, an Irish bull, and
could not, therefore, have been uttered by a
King of Hesse-Heilfels. A great controversy
over this question arose in the German universities,
and the matter is still under discussion.
It has served at least one valuable
purpose, in furnishing another outlet
for pent-up erudition. German scholarship
needs constant relief of this kind, and what
is known as the Schwartzburger Irish-Bull
problem has been of great service to the congested
erudition of the university towns.</p>

<p>The castle of the Schwartzburgers in which
we find the reigning king pursuing his studies
in poker under the tutorship of a wandering
genius from Connecticut was built late
in the thirteenth century, and “was restored,”
as the guide-books say, early in the present
century by King Rudolph’s father. “The
restoration is incomplete,” Bennett had said
to the king, a few days after he had been admitted
to the royal circle. “Your castle is
picturesque but unhealthy, romantic but
rheumatic, with too many relics and too few
conveniences. What you need at once, your
majesty, is sanitary plumbing, a few passenger
and freight elevators, and an electric
lighting plant.”</p>

<p>King Rudolph had gazed suspiciously at
the smooth-faced, smooth-tongued youth,
whose nervously energetic manner was aggravated
by his efforts to make his meaning
clear in the German tongue. Bennett was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
well-equipped linguist, but the German dialect
spoken in Hesse-Heilfels was new to
him. He was by temperament loquacious
and restless, and it annoyed him to find
that his vocabulary was frequently defective
when he was endeavoring to convince the
king that a certain line of action was imperatively
and immediately necessary. King
Rudolph had rejected, for the time being,
the suggestions thrown out by Bennett regarding
repairs to the castle, and had devoted
such hours as he could snatch from affairs of
state to learning the ins and outs of the game
of draw poker. The result was that Rudolph
XII. and Jonathan Edwards Bennett spent
twelve hours of every twenty-four in the
king’s private apartments—with royalty and
democracy separated by only a table, a pack
of cards, and a set of ivory chips. Already
the kingdom had begun to feel the effects of
Rudolph’s example, for the palace sets the
fashions in Hesse-Heilfels, and when the
king plays poker in his castle the peasant in
the valley is anxious to learn the difference
between a royal flush and a full house. When
Jonathan Edwards Bennett taught Rudolph
XII., the reigning Schwartzburger, to play
jack-pots he started a poker avalanche that
poured down from the castle into the valleys
and eventually caused the most serious upheaval
in the modern history of the kingdom
of Hesse-Heilfels.</p>

<p>“If your luck continues, your majesty,”
remarked Bennett, as he shuffled the cards
and gazed thoughtfully through the open
window toward the distant mountain-tops,
“I shall be compelled to mortgage my farm
in Litchfield County, Connecticut.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>There was silence in the stately old chamber
for a moment, broken only by the ticking
of an antique clock that had punctuated the
lives of many generations of Schwartzburgers.
King Rudolph thrust a trembling hand
through his scanty gray locks and smiled
slyly.</p>

<p>“What’s the farm worth?” he asked, eagerly
seizing his five cards and looking at
them anxiously.</p>

<p>The expression upon Bennett’s clear-cut,
pale, and rather handsome face did not
change. He gazed stolidly at his hand, and
calmly discarded three of his five cards. A
close observer would have noted, however,
that the dark eyes of the youth glanced now
and then at the king’s heavy countenance and
seemed to read the very soul of his royal opponent.</p>

<p>“The farm is worth a contract to renovate
your castle,” answered the Yankee coldly.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” cried the king, as
he again added a small pile of Bennett’s
chips to his own store.</p>

<p>“I mean this, your majesty,” answered the
American. “I’ll make a bet with you—the
cards to decide the wager—by the terms of
which you are bound to win. We’ll throw a
cold hand for the stakes. See? If your cards
beat mine, you own my farm. If I win, you
are to sign a contract authorizing me to take
charge of the internal improvements not only
of your castle but of your kingdom. I am to
make this castle a modern residence, to improve
the roads in your kingdom, and to put a
little snap and ginger into your people. You
are falling years behind other civilized lands.
You need my services, your majesty, as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
Moses who shall lead you out of the desert of
the past into the flowery plains of the future.
See? It was a lucky day for you when I entered
your kingdom.”</p>

<p>The Schwartzburgers have never been
noted for quick-wittedness. Their minds
have always moved slowly, unless their temper
was aroused. The only way to make a
Schwartzburger think and act hastily is to
stir up his anger. At this moment Rudolph
XII. was gazing at the Yankee in a dazed
way. He seemed to be striving dully to find
a ray of light by which to throw the American’s
startling proposition into effective relief.
He evidently harbored a vague suspicion
that he was in imminent danger of losing
his royal and time-honored prerogative of
fleecing the wandering sheep that came within
his reach. The idea of subletting a portion
of his royal authority to a comparative stranger
was not attractive. Furthermore, King
Rudolph realized that by delegating to Bennett
the authority he craved, he would arouse
the antagonism of the most influential and
powerful subjects of his realm.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the king of Hesse-Heilfels
was fascinated by the chance of winning an
estate in America. To his mind “a farm in
Connecticut” represented a domain from
which vast wealth might be derived. Rumors
of the fabulous riches possessed by
American tourists who had at times visited
his castle had made a strong impression upon
King Rudolph. Furthermore, the microbe
of poker was at work in the royal blood.
The fever caused by jack-pot germs was having
its delirious influence upon the king’s
mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>“By a cold hand,” remarked the king slowly,
“you mean that we stake everything on
one deal?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Bennett, “we throw the
cards face upward and make our discards
openly. It is very simple. Shall I proceed?”</p>

<p>At that instant the doors behind Bennett’s
chair were thrown open and a girl of eighteen
hastily entered the apartment. The
American turned toward her, flushed perceptibly,
and arose from his seat.</p>

<p>The Princess Hilda, the king’s niece, paid
not the slightest attention to Bennett, but
approached the king with a look of determination
upon her handsome face. Her cheeks
were slightly reddened from excitement, and
her dark blue eyes seemed almost black as
they rested upon her royal uncle. There was
silence for an instant. The opening of the
doors had tempted a breeze from the mountains
to enter the palace through the windows
and shake the antique hangings as it passed.
It caressed Hilda’s golden hair gently as she
stood before the king and said:</p>

<p>“Pardon me, your majesty, but I have
news—state news—that brooks no delay.
No other messenger seemed quite fitted for
the task, so I have come to tell you that——”</p>

<p>King Rudolph raised his hand with an
angry gesture.</p>

<p>“You must wait, princess. Is it not enough
that I should be vexed with cares of state by
my ministers and secretaries without being
interrupted in my too few hours of relaxation
by you? Furthermore, there <em>is</em> an affair of
state—a most important affair of state—here
at issue at this moment. Come, mein Herr
Bennett, throw the cards! Wait, Hilda, do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
not be offended! Watch my luck, princess!
You shall stand here to bring me good fortune.
Whichever way it goes, you say, mein
Herr, I win? So be it! I take your word!
Let’s draw. Forgive me, princess; I know
your news will keep.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.</h3>

</div>

<p>“Pardon me, your majesty,” said Bennett,
holding a pack of cards unshuffled
in his hand. “I hesitate to cross your will,
but if the princess really has important
news——?”</p>

<p>The speaker looked up at the Princess
Hilda deferentially, but his intercession in
her behalf met with no reward. Far from
seeming pleased at his support, she turned
her back upon him, her face white and set,
and gazed reproachfully at her king and
uncle.</p>

<p>“Throw out the cards,” commanded King
Rudolph sternly. “Am I to be told by a
chit of a girl how to rule my kingdom? Remain
where you are, Princess Hilda, and see
me win a province in the land across the
sea.”</p>

<p>The little group at that moment presented
a picturesque tableau. In that old castle
within which the centuries had seen enacted
many tragedies, comedies, farce-comedies,
and burlesques, lost to the world forever for
lack of imminent playwrights, an episode in
a stirring drama was about to take place
against an appropriate <i lang="fr">mise-en-scène</i>.</p>

<p>The king’s face, flushed with the excitement
of the crisis, wore an expression of
mingled cupidity and impatience. His fat,
reddish hand rapped the table nervously.
Opposite to him sat Bennett, a prey to conflicting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
emotions, but outwardly calm. He
had hitherto been too much occupied in gaining
an influence over King Rudolph to notice
the beauty of Princess Hilda, but as she stood
there, cold, disdainful, silent, while the breeze
gently caressed her golden-brown hair, the
American adventurer felt tempted to throw
the mischievous cards into the king’s face
and beg forgiveness from the princess on his
bended knees.</p>

<p>“Count von Hohenlinden,” began the princess
stubbornly.</p>

<p>The king put up his hand deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“The Count von——!” Princess Hilda got
no further.</p>

<p>“I draw to my pair of knaves,” cried King
Rudolph, thrusting three useless cards aside
excitedly.</p>

<p>“You do, indeed,” said Hilda, under her
breath, and glancing pointedly at Bennett.
She had not lowered her voice sufficiently to
prevent the American from catching the drift
of her remark. He tossed three cards toward
the king.</p>

<p>“Four of a kind!” cried the delighted
Schwartzburger, pointing at the cards triumphantly.
“My jacks will take your farm,
Herr Bennett.”</p>

<p>“But I draw to queens,” remarked the
American quietly and casting a quick glance
at Princess Hilda. “Ha, was I not right?
Are not the queens on my side? Look at
that, your majesty! Four queens! I win my
contract. Das ist wahr!”</p>

<p>King Rudolph gazed blankly at the cards
before him. By a marvellous stroke of luck
the American had beaten the king’s four
jacks. Novice though he was at poker, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
Schwartzburger realized that he had lost the
stakes at a moment when the chances were
a thousand to one in his favor.</p>

<p>“Gott im Himmel!” he cried angrily, hurling
the pack of cards through the window,
while his greenish-gray eyes glared fiercely
at his opponent, “what mad devil is in the
cards?”</p>

<p>“I had wonderful luck,” said Bennett
gently, rising from his seat and glancing
imploringly at the princess.</p>

<p>“The Count von Hohenlinden, Your Majesty,”
cried Hilda, paying no attention to
Bennett.</p>

<p>King Rudolph arose from his chair. He
was a short, thickset man, clumsy in movement,
and much too heavy for his height.</p>

<p>“Will you be quiet, niece?” he exclaimed,
his breath coming and going with asthmatic
friction. “Let me understand this gentleman.
Herr Bennett, you have won the cold
hand——”</p>

<p>“And the marble heart,” muttered Bennett
mournfully.</p>

<p>“As I understand it,” went on the king,
“you purpose to put this castle and the roads,
parks, bridges, and forests of my kingdom
into a condition more worthy of the nineteenth
century than is their present status.
Am I right?”</p>

<p>“That is the proposition, your majesty.”</p>

<p>“But there are many difficulties in the
way, Herr Bennett. I will meet with resistance
at every point. I have ministers—a
prime minister, heads of departments, red
tape, precedent, national prejudice, and a
large family of impecunious relatives, already
in alliance against you and your projects.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
Ach Himmel! I thought my four jacks would
solve my difficulties—and now I am worse off
than ever.”</p>

<p>The Princess Hilda had retired to a window
and was gazing pensively out upon hills
and valleys over which the Schwartzburgers
had lorded it for many generations. Here
and there between the hills she could catch
a glimpse of the stately Rhine, as it flowed
serenely past the castellated summits where
Romans, Teutons, and tourists had fussed
and fretted through the centuries. Suddenly
the king turned toward her.</p>

<p>“Count von Hohenlinden,” he cried. “You
spoke of him, my princess. He is my financier.
I need his advice. Have you news of
him, Hilda?” The princess turned and approached
the king.</p>

<p>“The countess came to me this morning in
tears,” she said quietly. “Count von Hohenlinden
has gone.”</p>

<p>“Gone?” cried King Rudolph in amazement.
“Gone where?”</p>

<p>“No one knows. I fear, your majesty—I
fear from what the countess said—that—that—he
is a defaulter.”</p>

<p>“Mein Gott! Mein Gott!” exclaimed the
king, sinking into a chair. “It cannot be!
And yet—and yet—he had full control of my
treasury. He told me yesterday—but what
matters it what he said then? Call von
Schwalbach to me. I tell you, Herr Bennett,
if my prime minister has allowed the
count to loot my treasury I will have his
life. Quick! call a page and send him for
von Schwalbach.”</p>

<p>“Alas, your majesty,” said the princess
soothingly, “von Schwalbach has also disappeared.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
It is said that he and the count left
the kingdom last night, riding their wheels
through a secret pass in the hills.”</p>

<p>The countenance of royalty had turned
white with dismay. The king seemed to be
stricken helpless at one blow.</p>

<p>“My best friends gone,” he muttered.
“Gone—thieves that run off in the night!
And I—I have trusted them with my purse,
my honor, my very life. Tell me, Hilda,”
he went on, almost hysterically, “what caused
this downfall of men whose word was always
as good as gold, men who have been found
faithful to their trust for years?”</p>

<p>The broken king looked up pathetically at
his golden-haired niece. She smiled sadly
down at him, and then turned frowningly
toward Bennett, who stood, with one hand
resting upon the card-table, watching the
melancholy scene before him.</p>

<p>“One thing alone caused the ruin of the
men you trusted,” she said, and paused.</p>

<p>“And that was?” cried the king eagerly.</p>

<p>“Poker!” answered the princess simply.</p>

<p>Bennett stepped back as though struck by
a blow in the face, while the king sprang to
his feet and puffed helplessly for a moment.</p>

<p>“Donner und Blitzen!” blurted King Rudolph,
shaking his fist at the American, whose
white lips and flushed cheeks gave evidence
of his inward agitation. “You are responsible
for this, Herr Bennett! You sneak into
my kingdom and tell me you have news from
a better world than mine. You tell me that
I and my people are ‘behind the times.’ I
give you room in my palace and you complain
that we have no gas, no electricity, no
telephones, no cable cars to climb the hills,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
no new castles. All is old, you whisper,
time-worn, covered with lichen, useless,
dead. And I, the only fool of all the
Schwartzburgers, listen to you and grow
cold to my old counsellors. You talk of
progress—and give me poker. You speak of
grandeur—and make me a gambler. You
point to a rainbow—and pick my pockets.
It is enough. I have learned my lesson.
Go, Herr Bennett—and may the curse of the
King of Hesse-Heilfels be with you to the
end.”</p>

<p>King Rudolph sank back into his chair,
panting for breath.</p>

<p>At this instant a man burst into the room
unannounced, dragging with him a page who
had sought to check his impetuosity.</p>

<p>The intruder was a comical figure at his
most dignified moments, but at this instant
he looked as if he had escaped from a light
opera company, just when the audience was
roaring at his best joke. He was not over
four feet three in height. His hair was tousled
and of a light yellow hue. His features were
large, especially his nose. Under the influence
of great excitement his eyes bulged
from his head as if in search of mislaid spectacles.
He was attired in a green velvet
jacket and small clothes, with a frilled shirt
and a small sword at his side. In his hand
he carried a green cap, from which a long
black feather trailed along the floor.</p>

<p>“Your majesty, pardon me,” he cried, falling
upon one knee before the king. “I protest
to the throne. I know that I am right!
Nicht wahr?”</p>

<p>In spite of the solemnity of the crisis, King
Rudolph laughed aloud, the Princess Hilda<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
smiled, and an expression of hope rested upon
Jonathan Bennett’s disturbed countenance.
The sudden change in the king’s mood was
encouraging.</p>

<p>“Rise, Cousin Fritz,” said the king jocosely.
“You never appeal to the king in
vain. What is your grievance. Perhaps
your troubles may prove for the moment
a counter-irritant to mine.”</p>

<p>“Because I’m called the king’s jester,
Your Majesty, they think I’m a fool,” said
the little man, readjusting the feather in his
cap. “But I’m not the fool that I look, am
I, Schwartzburg?” Here the dwarf winked
gayly at the king. Then his anger seemed
to return. “Gott im Himmel!” he cried,
“they gave me the lie, me, Cousin Fritz,
who could tell the truth in Latin and Greek
at the age of six. It’s an outrage, your
majesty.”</p>

<p>“But what was the cause of all this?” asked
the king, beginning to look bored and casting
uneasy glances at Bennett, upon whom the
royal curse had not had the intended effect.</p>

<p>“The cause, your majesty?” repeated the
dwarf. “Cause enough. They said I lied
when I told them that four of a kind beat
a full house. Think of that, Herr Bennett.
They took my money—and I held four aces.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.</h3>

</div>

<p>“Bennett ’82 cannot be explained by any
known law,” a Yale professor had once remarked.
“He may astonish the world by
his genius, or end a short career as a tramp.
The splendor of his inherent possibilities
emphasizes the dangers that surround such
a temperament as his.”</p>

<p>Ten years had passed since Bennett had
been graduated, not without honors, from
Yale, but he had not as yet fulfilled the professor’s
prophecy. He had not made the
world ring with his name; neither had he
sunk to the level of a knight of the road.
There still remained a chance, however, that
the foresight of the professor would be vindicated.
Bennett was now thirty-two years
of age. He had assiduously cultivated the
gifts that had led the Yale professor to ascribe
to him the peculiarities and possibilities
that appertain to genius. Bennett had
become an accomplished linguist, a poet, a
musician, a diplomatist, and a schemer. But
he had neglected the means and methods
that lead to permanent success, and his love
of adventure had served to make him more
of a tramp than a celebrity. The returns
from his genius must still be marked “scattering.”</p>

<p>The erratic nature of the man was well
illustrated by his invasion of the kingdom of
Hesse-Heilfels. One evening in Berlin he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
had listened to a description of King Rudolph’s
picturesque domain. The eccentricities
of that petty monarch had aroused Bennett’s
curiosity, and he had determined to
make a study at close quarters of a royal establishment
that still retained many of the
peculiarities of mediæval monarchies.</p>

<p>Bennett had been fortunate enough to find
luck as his ally upon entering the confines of
Hesse-Heilfels. At the very first inn in the
kingdom in which he had laid aside his knapsack,
he had learned that King Rudolph was
suffering from a severe indisposition that had
baffled the skill of the court physicians. It
did not take Bennett long to come to the
conclusion that the reigning Schwartzburger
was suffering from inflammatory rheumatism,
an affection that Bennett numbered
among his family heirlooms. “Litchfield
County may be short on romance, but it is
long on rheumatism,” he said to himself. “I
think I can cure King Rudolph.”</p>

<p>There is no necessity for dwelling upon the
details of Bennett’s success as a court physician.
He had written a carefully worded
letter offering his services to the afflicted
monarch “free of charge unless a cure is
effected.” King Rudolph, weary of suffering
and disgusted with the impotence of his own
doctors, had sent for the young American
and, much to the astonishment and annoyance
of the court, had given him full charge
of his royal person. The cure effected by the
gifted amateur had won him the friendship
of the king, and the enmity of the court
circle. In spite of his suavity, Bennett had
been unable to make himself popular in a
household in which the good-will of the king<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
must be purchased at the expense of general
detestation. The feeling against Bennett
was intensified, of course, because of his
foreign birth. Never before, in the long
and polychromatic history of the House of
Schwartzburg, had a stranger from a land
far over sea become at a bound an influential
factor in shaping the destinies of the
kingdom of Hesse-Heilfels. Upon the door
of his bedchamber one morning, Bennett had
found inscribed in chalk, the words, “Geben
sie acht. Halt!” The warning had opened
his eyes to the fact that the enemies he had
made were bold and determined. But he had
smiled mockingly, rubbed the chalk from the
panel, and made his way, humming a merry
catch, to the king’s apartments.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Bennett was not in a joyous
mood as he gazed at the moon-kissed river
and mountains from a balcony adjoining his
apartments on the evening of the day upon
which our tale opens. Although the king
had apologized in the afternoon for his bitter
denunciation of the American in the morning,
Bennett realized that his hold upon
royal favor was insecure, and that as Rudolph’s
rheumatism improved, and his fondness
for poker decreased, the end of his adventure
would impend.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours before this Bennett
would have felt no special annoyance had
a decree of perpetual banishment from the
kingdom of Hesse-Heilfels been enforced
against him. But as he puffed cigar smoke
into the balmy air and gazed dreamily at the
silver thread that gleamed between the distant
hills, the face of the Princess Hilda—proud,
cold, and beautiful—seemed to taunt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
him, defy him, fascinate him. His pulse
beat wildly as the temptation to break this
haughty woman’s pride, to make her eyes
grow gentle at his approach and her lips
melt into smiles as he addressed her, swept
over him.</p>

<p>The hopelessness of his longing was clear
to him. The princess looked upon him as a
quack, an adventurer, a man to be shunned
and despised. She had never vouchsafed to
him a word, a glance, the slightest recognition
of his existence. To win her regard
seemed to be impossible. The sceptre of
Hesse-Heilfels was as much within his reach
as the good-will of the Princess Hilda. Nevertheless,
Jonathan Bennett, soothed by tobacco,
lulled by the glories of a summer
night, haunted by the swarming spirits of
the storied Rhine, dreamed his dream of love
and conquest and allowed his wild fancies to
lead him far from the vulgar plane of poker,
sanitary plumbing, and “sure cures” for
rheumatism.</p>

<p>“Ach, mein Herr, but you look like an archangel
planning a crime.”</p>

<p>Bennett sprang up from his seat in dismay.
He had carefully locked the doors of his
apartments, and this sudden invasion of his
privacy smacked of the supernatural. Cousin
Fritz, with a mocking smile playing across
his gnarled face, displayed a mischievous joy
in the American’s consternation.</p>

<p>“Be seated, Herr Bennett,” cried the dwarf,
bowing with exaggerated politeness. “I owe
you an apology—but this is one of my jokes.
Is it not a good one? Ha—ha!” He danced
up and down the balcony with weird agility
for a moment. Then he seated himself upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
the stone coping and tilted his feathered cap
sideways upon his overgrown head.</p>

<p>“You will forgive me,” said Bennett gently,
offering the jester a cigar, which the latter
accepted with much ceremony, “if I ask you
how you managed to surprise me so successfully?”</p>

<p>Cousin Fritz winked knowingly and blew
a cloud of smoke into the air.</p>

<p>“I’ve lived in this castle a thousand years,”
he answered solemnly. “It has taken me all
that time to learn its secrets. Hist, Herr
Bennett, they think it’s my business to amuse
the king. Nonsense. That’s my pleasure.
My work for a thousand years has been to discover
all the mysteries of this old castle. I
know them all now. What is the result?
I’ll tell you, Herr Bennett, and I’ll tell you
why I tell you. You made those scoundrels
return my money this afternoon. Four aces!
The robbers! But they took your word on
poker, Herr Bennett—although they hate
you. Do you hear me? They hate you.”</p>

<p>The dwarf chuckled with inward glee. He
seemed to rejoice in Bennett’s unpopularity.</p>

<p>“And what,” asked Bennett, not wholly
pleased with the jester’s untimely jocularity,
“what has been the result of your thousand
years of discovery in this ancient pile? You
started out to tell me.”</p>

<p>“It has been,” answered the dwarf, seeming
to weigh his words carefully, “it has
been to make me king. These puppets come
and go and wear the crown and hold the
sceptre, but through the centuries I am
monarch of Hesse-Heilfels. I could tell you
tales that would make your black hair turn
white, tales of my power—of <em>my</em> power, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
jester, Cousin Fritz, a buffoon for a thousand
years!”</p>

<p>There was something so uncanny in the
little wizard’s words and manner that Bennett
could hardly repress a gesture of abhorrence.
A madman smoking a cigar in the
moonlight on a balcony overlooking the
Rhine was a creature so out of touch with
nineteenth-century ideas that Bennett was
tempted to believe that he had fallen asleep
and had been attacked by a nightmare.</p>

<p>Suddenly Cousin Fritz hopped down from
his perch and sprang toward Bennett. The
movement was so sudden that the American
had no time to rise.</p>

<p>“Look there,” whispered the dwarf, pointing
with trembling hand toward a group of
trees at the edge of the park, several hundred
feet in front of them. “Do you see
those shadows among the trees?”</p>

<p>Bennett’s eyes followed the little man’s
gesture. He could make out the figures of
several men who had gathered in a group
beneath the trees. The moon painted their
shadows black against the greensward.</p>

<p>“Do you know what they seek?” asked
the dwarf, shaking with inward laughter.
“They seek your life, Herr Bennett! Isn’t
that a joke? I couldn’t make a better one,
could I?”</p>

<p>The American felt an almost irresistible
impulse to hurl the uncanny creature into
the abyss beneath them. The dwarf’s idea
of humor did not appeal to Bennett. As a
Yankee he possessed a keen appreciation of
the ludicrous, but the prospect of assassination
did not strike him as laughable. Cousin
Fritz—abnormally sympathetic as he was—realized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
that his companion was not in a
joyous mood.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed, Herr Bennett,” he
said, “what I tell you is true. I heard those
men planning your death. They hate you
because my cousin Rudolph has grown fond
of you. But, never fear, I will save you
from their machinations. Did I not tell you
that I had been King of Hesse-Heilfels for
a thousand years? Well, the king is on your
side. I decree that you shall not die. Do
you doubt my power to save you? Look
here!”</p>

<p>The dwarf sprang with wonderful agility
upon the coping and stood upright, his
crooked figure standing out against the sky
like a silhouette to the eyes of the astonished
American. Seizing his cap the king’s jester
waved it frantically to and fro, as if making
a signal to the men at the edge of the park.</p>

<p>“Come here, Herr Bennett,” he cried.
“See? Am I not king? Have they not
obeyed my command? See? They are
gone?”</p>

<p>Bennett gazed searchingly at the trees beneath
which the group had stood but a moment
before. There was nothing there but
the moonlit glory of the forest.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.</h3>

</div>

<p>“Gute Nacht, Herr Bennett! Schlafen Sie
wohl!”</p>

<p>The dwarf, smiling mischievously, disappeared
through the entrance and Bennett
closed the heavy oaken door and carefully
bolted it. His madcap visitor had refused
to satisfy his curiosity upon several important
points, and the American made ready
for bed with a disturbed mind. Was Cousin
Fritz really his friend? That the dwarf was
crazy he had no doubt, but his insanity was
not dangerous if he was actually well disposed
toward the stranger. But the dwarf’s
mysterious and sudden appearance, his signal
to the men Bennett now called “the conspirators,”
and his stubborn refusal to answer
the questions put to him, combined to cast a
doubt upon his sincerity.</p>

<p>“The situation is certainly depressing,” soliloquized
Bennett, as he slowly doffed his
clothes. “The king blows hot and cold, and,
so far as I can learn, is handicapped by an
empty treasury. The Princess Hilda holds
me in contempt and suspicion. The crazy
jester is not a safe ally. As for the court at
large, there is not a man or woman in the
circle who would not be glad to see me
driven out of the kingdom. It is more than
probable that there is a conspiracy on foot
against my life. And what do I gain by remaining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
here? Not one glance from her
wonderful eyes, not a smile from her sweet
lips; nothing but cold, contemptuous indifference.
Nobody, so far as I know, has ever
called Jonathan Edwards Bennett a fool, but
he deserves that name to-night. Heigh-ho!
a rolling stone gathers no moss, but it gets
a great many hard knocks.”</p>

<p>With this melancholy reflection, Bennett,
with a farewell glance at the moonlight
pouring in at the windows—which he had
taken care to fasten with bars—turned on
his pillow and wooed the fickle goddess
whose duty it is to reknit the raveled sleeve
of care. He was about to win a great victory
in his coquetting with sleep, when he
was startled into a sitting posture by a rap
on the panel of the door he had recently
bolted.</p>

<p>Bennett’s first thought was that he had
fallen into a doze and had been the victim
of a mild attack of nightmare. He listened
intently. The breeze from the hills, defying
the broken windows, stirred the heavy hangings
surrounding his old-fashioned bed, and
the mysterious noises that haunt an ancient
castle at night fell upon his ear. Suddenly a
gentle rap again echoed from the opposite
side of the chamber. The American pushed
aside his bed curtains and stole softly toward
the door. The ease with which Cousin Fritz
had defied bolts and bars had not tended to
allay Bennett’s growing distrust of his surroundings.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” he asked in a low voice as
he reached the door. There was a silence
for an instant. Bennett, who prided himself
upon his courage, was ashamed to realize<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
that his heart was beating with an abnormal
celerity.</p>

<p>“I come from the princess,” answered a
woman’s voice. “I have a message for Herr
Bennett.”</p>

<p>“Wait just a moment, then,” said the
astonished American, hurrying toward the
chair upon which he had placed his clothes.
That Princess Hilda wished to communicate
with him was a fact so surprising that his
agitation increased. His hands trembled as
he hurriedly donned his garments and endeavored
to render his toilet worthy of the
audience before him.</p>

<p>Presently he unbolted the great door, and
against the moonlight that streamed through
the corridor he saw the figure of one of the
princess’s waiting-women.</p>

<p>“Let us go as quietly as possible,” she
said. “The Princess Hilda will receive you
in the Hall of Armor.”</p>

<p>They crept softly along the corridor and
down a flight of stone steps that seemed to
lead them from the moonlight into the black
depths of eternal gloom. The woman rapped
on a small door at the foot of the stairway.
As they awaited the answer to her signal,
the thought flashed through Bennett’s mind
that he had placed himself in the power of
those who might prove to be his enemies.
He sought in vain to read the face of the
woman at his side. Instinctively he placed
his hand upon his hip pocket, in which he had
always carried a revolver. A moment later
he felt ashamed of his fears. The small
door had been thrown back, and upon his
startled gaze broke a vision that recalled his
youthful dreams of romance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>Through the stained-glass windows of a
great hall the moonlight streamed in multicolored
beams. Like a mediæval army mustered
at midnight stood the grim figures of
the armored Schwartzburgers. Long black
shadows, weird and wavering, made effective
background for the polychromatic glories of
this dazzling scene.</p>

<p>And there in the foreground, the moonlight
caressing her golden hair, stood the
Princess Hilda, a vision of beauty amid the
relics of old wars and the steel-clad presentments
of her blood-stained ancestors. The
clear-cut face, the stately figure, the regal
simplicity of her attire, seemed to make her
at that instant the very incarnation of all
that was noblest in the mediæval cult. She
appeared to be a spirit from the past haunting
the scenes where chivalrous warriors in
the days of old had paid the homage of death
in return for the smile of love.</p>

<p>Bennett felt dazed by the unexpected
beauty of the picture that met his eyes.
For a moment he doubted the reality of the
scene before him. Was he dreaming? Was
it not certain that a love song, followed by a
martial chorus, would soon recall him to his
senses; that he would find himself not in a
castle but in an opera house?</p>

<p>Suddenly the voice of the princess convinced
him of the reality of his surroundings.</p>

<p>“Herr Bennett, accept my thanks. It was
kind of you to come to me.”</p>

<p>The words were unexpected. They placed
the princess under obligation to a man she
had hitherto treated with contemptuous indifference.
But her voice was cold and formal.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
Bennett realized that, like the figures
of her ancestors, she was clad in armor.
Theirs was of steel, hers of pride.</p>

<p>“It would be the greatest pleasure of my
life to serve you, Princess Hilda,” said the
American, the tone of his voice leaving no
doubt of his sincerity.</p>

<p>There was silence between them for a
time. In some remote corner of the castle
a door creaked on its hinges. The waiting-woman
made a gesture of impatience somewhere
in the shadows, and a piece of armor
clanked angrily.</p>

<p>“If that is true,” said the princess, with less
coldness in her tones than before, “I shall
put you to the test at once. Herr Bennett,
I am in sore distress.”</p>

<p>How great a sacrifice it was for this proud
woman to meet him thus secretly and to confess
that he could be of service to her in her
hour of trouble, Bennett was sufficiently generous
to realize. Irresponsible in many ways,
brilliant but erratic, the American was essentially
a gentleman. Furthermore, he had
never felt for a woman the reverential admiration
that the golden-haired vision before
him inspired. There was something unearthly
in the influence she exercised over
him at this moment. The glory of renunciation—the
crowning beauty of the age of
chivalry—seemed to affect him as he stood
there in the shimmering moonlight, a modern
knight-errant vowing fealty to a high
ideal at a mediæval shrine.</p>

<p>“I repeat,” he said, “my promise to serve
you as best I may.”</p>

<p>“Then I implore you, Herr Bennett,” went
on the princess in a low voice, “to leave the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
kingdom at once. The harm you have
wrought may never be wholly undone, but
you can, at least, save us from further disaster.”</p>

<p>“It shall be as you wish, Princess Hilda,”
he said sadly. “But tell me, is the crisis
more threatening than I had feared?”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” she answered, a melancholy
smile playing across her face. “The
king is driven to his wit’s ends, and to-night
he had news from below that fills him with
consternation. As you know, his brother,
my uncle Wilhelm, plots for his dethronement.
His emissaries throughout the kingdom
are fostering discontent. The recent
defalcations have emboldened the schemers
and the feeling against the king is on the
increase. There is only one thing that can
save us, Herr Bennett. If it is noised abroad
in the morning that you have left Hesse-Heilfels,
never to return, his majesty’s subjects
will take heart and rally to his support.
Am I not right?”</p>

<p>Her appeal to his judgment pleased Bennett.
Furthermore, he knew that the conclusion
she had reached was sound. Nevertheless,
the sacrifice he was about to make
was greater than she could understand. That
a Yankee adventurer should dare to harbor
for a princess of the house of Schwartzburg
a feeling akin to love was a possibility that,
he well knew, she could not comprehend.</p>

<p>“I fear,” he said gloomily, “that you are
not wrong, Princess Hilda, in looking upon
me as the Jonah who is sinking the ship of
state. It is well, perhaps, that I should go
at once. But give me leave to say that in
obeying your commands I feel a joy that is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
begotten of my power to repair in part the
wrongs that I have done to you, and a sorrow
that springs from the thought that I shall
never look upon your face again.”</p>

<p>Impulsively he stepped forward, and bending
his knee kissed the cold hand she held
out to him. Then he arose, gazed for a moment
at her white, sad face, and turned and
left the hall.</p>

<p>How he reached his apartments, Bennett
never knew. That he groped for many minutes
in a darkness that seemed eternal, bruising
himself in his efforts to find the moonlit
corridor, he remembered later on; but the
bitterness of his renunciation—fantastic
though his love might be—was the one feeling
that dominated him during that midnight
passage through unknown hallways and up
shadow-haunted stairs.</p>

<p>As he glanced around his bedchamber a
conviction came over him that it had been
entered since his departure. He had found
the oak doors closed, as he had left them,
but there was something in the appearance
of the apartment—he could not say just what
it was—that convinced him that some one
had paid him a visit during his absence. He
approached the bed and pulled aside the curtains.
Upon one of the pillows a piece of
note-paper had been pinned. Seizing it nervously,
Bennett hurried to a window, through
which the moonlight was still streaming.
Scrawled in pencil, the paper bore the following
lines:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Come to the king at once when you return.
He is in grave danger, and so are you.
This is not a jest.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Cousin Fritz.</span>”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.</h3>

</div>

<p>The inn at which Jonathan Edwards Bennett,
some weeks before the present crisis,
had learned that King Rudolph XII. was
afflicted with rheumatism, had become the
centre of high pressure for politics and
poker. “Destroy the inns and wine-shops in
your domain, and you will never be bothered
by conspiracies,” a diplomatist and scholar
had once written to a former king of Hesse-Heilfels.
“I prefer my inns and my rebels to
the loss of the former,” the conservative
Schwartzburger had answered. It is highly
probable that the king in this instance displayed
more wisdom than the diplomatist.</p>

<p>The ancient hostelry to which reference
was made in a former chapter presented a
picture of unwonted gayety on the moonlit
night that had brought so many adventures
to the distraught American at the castle.
The wine that has made the Schwartzburger
vineyards famous the world over has served
to give to the inhabitants of Hesse-Heilfels
a vivacity that is not generally characteristic
of the German nation.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say, in illustration of
the foregoing proposition, that King Rudolph’s
subjects were the only people in the
empire who would have become fascinated
by the game of draw poker at what might be
termed “one fell swoop.” Beneath their
phlegmatic exterior, the inhabitants of Hesse-Heilfels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
conceal temperaments highly impressionable
and excitable.</p>

<p>“Give me one card, Heinrich,” cried a
short, fat, red-faced man, glancing slyly at
the dealer and solemnly placing his discard
on the table.</p>

<p>“Mein Gott, that looks as if he was drawing
to a flush,” exclaimed one of the opponents,
throwing away his hand and gazing
ruefully at his lost “ante.”</p>

<p>Grouped around the four players in a rear
room on the ground floor of the inn were ten
or twelve men, varying in years from youth
to old age. Their garb was picturesque and
many-hued. Green or brown caps, velveteen
coats, and low shoes combined to make their
costumes pleasing to the eye of an observer
sensitive to artistic effects. The eighteenth
century in costume had met the nineteenth
century at poker, and the outcome was a
scene worthy the brush of a Dutch painter.</p>

<p>“Bring wine,” cried one of the discouraged
gamblers, who had lost steadily for an hour
or more. “This is the devil’s game! Here,
you smug-faced Wilhelm! Repeat a paternoster
over my chips. It will break the spell
Satan has cast upon my luck.”</p>

<p>“Heinrich wins again!” murmured the
group of onlookers. “It is marvellous.”</p>

<p>“Ach, Heinrich,” exclaimed a large-eyed,
tow-headed youth, “have you been taking
private lessons at the castle?”</p>

<p>A general laugh followed this sally, and
the game went on. Suddenly a rich voice
arose from a corner of the room that lay
concealed in shadow. “Hush, it is Carl!
Let’s hear his new song!” cried the group
surrounding the gamblers. The four players<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
withdrew the chips they had placed in the
centre of the table and suspended their game
for a while. No sound interfered with the
thrilling effect of the baritone’s clear, full
tones.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The applause that awarded the singer’s
effort was neither loud nor enthusiastic.
This open commission of the crime of <i lang="fr">lese
majesté</i> in a public inn sent a thrill of astonishment
through the crowd, and with one
impulse the poker players threw down their
cards and arose from the table.</p>

<p>“White livers!” cried the voice of the singer.
“Are you afraid of shadows?” Carl,
the famous baritone, stepped forward into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
the centre of the room. He was not only the
best singer and the most accomplished musician,
but also the handsomest man in Hesse-Heilfels.
“Gamblers, wine-bibbers, cowards!
I blush for my country when I look at
you!”</p>

<p>Carl Eingen was the only man in Hesse-Heilfels
who would have dared to utter such
words to these men, flushed as they were
with wine. But his influence over them was
strong, and they gazed upon his clear-cut,
impassioned face with affection and admiration.
He looked every inch a leader as he
stood there bareheaded, his dark, curly hair
adding to the beauty of his well-shaped head
and pale, strong countenance.</p>

<p>“What have you done?” he went on sternly.
“You have allowed a stranger from across
the sea to become the head and front of this
ancient realm. You sit here, playing the
game he taught your king, while your country
goes to ruin and the castle upon yonder
hill becomes a plague-spot that throws a
blight upon a whole people. Are you men—or
simply wine-vats? Where is the manhood
that made your ancestors great in war
and men of force in peace? You have heard
that in every inn, in every house in Hesse-Heilfels
our countrymen, gone mad over a
foolish game of chance, spend their days and
nights playing poker. You have heard that
chaos reigns at the castle, that the kingdom
is placed in peril by a ruler who has become
the tool of an adventurer, a man who has no
claim upon the king, no right to our regard.
Again I ask you, are you men? Think not
that the people have no rights. The King
of Hesse-Heilfels is absolute in power, but I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
say to you, my friends, that he forfeits his
divine right when he gives that power to a
trickster, to a man of alien blood who loves
us not. Do you weigh my words? Tell me,
my countrymen, do I not speak the truth?”</p>

<p>“Ja wohl, Carl!” cried one of his hearers.
“You are right. We will do as you direct,
eh, my friends?”</p>

<p>A murmur of assent arose from the awed
and penitent throng. One of the poker
players seized the cards and chips that lay
upon the table and hurled them passionately
through the open window.</p>

<p>“Lead on, Carl,” he cried. “We’ll follow
you to the death.”</p>

<p>“Lead on, Carl. You’ll find that we are
men,” shouted another.</p>

<p>“Down with the Yankee!” cried a third.</p>

<p>“Wilhelm for king!” came from the rear
of the room.</p>

<p>“Ja! Ja! Wilhelm, Wilhelm!” arose the
cry as the crowd poured from the hot and
smoke-choked room into the cool, soft night
outside, where the light of the gentle moon
threw its silvery glory upon a scene well
fitted to rouse in the hearts of men a love
of fatherland.</p>

<p>Carl Eingen hurried to the front, and turning
toward his overwrought followers, said
sternly:</p>

<p>“No noise! Remain as silent as the night.
We cannot overthrow a dynasty by childish
chatter. The man who utters a sound is a
traitor to Wilhelm, the rightful King of
Hesse-Heilfels.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, Carl, what is your plan?” asked
one of the revolutionists, pushing his way
through the throng to the leader’s side.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
“You can’t depose a king with a few half-drunken
men.”</p>

<p>Carl Eingen gazed searchingly at the pale,
drawn face of the speaker.</p>

<p>“Have no fear, Conrad,” he said, convinced
that he addressed a man not stirred by the
fumes of wine. “The guards at the palace
are on our side. From every part of the
kingdom our friends are hurrying toward the
castle. This is no midsummer night’s madness,
Conrad. It is simply a very small part
of a deep-laid scheme, conducted possibly
from Berlin and approved by one who is
greater than the king of Hesse-Heilfels.
These men with us I shall use for a special
purpose. The brunt of this business is borne
by others, but to me has been entrusted the
capture of Herr Bennett, the Yankee. I saw
that I could carry my point with our friends
here if I said the right word at the right
time. Their enthusiasm, however, is spasmodic,
and their lukewarmness, their dread
of the awful punishment that might come to
them, will return to them anon. But there
is inspiration in sharp work. We must give
them no time to think, Conrad! Just whisper
to Heinrich that it is our purpose to capture
the Yankee in his bed. It will revive their
waning spirits and act like wine upon their
blood.”</p>

<p>A hoarse murmur of approval again arose
from the hurrying throng as they learned the
special object of their expedition. Then in
absolute silence they stole beneath the trees
of the park toward the castle.</p>

<p>“There,” said Carl Eingen, taking Conrad
by the arm and pointing to a balcony that
jutted out from one of the corner towers o<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>f
the castle, “there is where the Yankee
sleeps.”</p>

<p>“I think I see some one moving up there,”
whispered Conrad excitedly. On the instant
the figure of the dwarf, an uncanny shape
seemingly begotten of the madness of their
rebellious dreams, appeared upon the stone
coping of the balcony.</p>

<p>“It’s Cousin Fritz,” exclaimed Conrad
hoarsely. “Is he in your secret? See how
he waves his cap.”</p>

<p>“Back, men!” cried Carl excitedly. “Get
into the shadow of the trees. No, Conrad,
that madcap dwarf is loyal to Rudolph, but
he knows our plans. In trying to win his
support I fear we have allowed him to learn
too much of our design. He may be crazy,
but he’s very clever. Confound such blundering!
We should have captured Cousin
Fritz and locked him up to-day. He knows
every nook and corner of the castle, and is
an ally worth a thousand men with guns.
But come, let us move! We’ll find friends
and counsellors across the park. Silence,
there! Forward, men, and make no noise—on
the peril of your lives.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.</h3>

</div>

<p>Jonathan Edwards Bennett found himself
in an uncomfortable predicament. He
had solemnly promised to leave the kingdom
at once, and he felt that the pledge he had
given to the Princess Hilda implied an obligation
upon his part to refrain from seeing
Rudolph XII. again. On the other hand, he
had no desire to risk his life in an effort to
escape. That he was surrounded by enemies
he could not doubt. He recalled the silhouette
made by the conspirators against the
moonlight, and it assumed a new significance
to his mind as a black menace. To leave the
castle at this moment would be to face mysterious
perils that he had no wish to confront.</p>

<p>If he obeyed the command in the jester’s
note he saw before him two unpleasant possibilities.
If Cousin Fritz played him false,
he might walk straight into the enemy’s
trap. If, on the other hand, the king really
awaited his coming, his recognition of the
summons might look to Princess Hilda like
treachery to her and disloyalty to his pledged
word.</p>

<p>Bennett musingly approached a window
and looked forth upon a scene that would
have thrilled him, at a happier moment,
with its calm beauty. The moon, now high
in the heavens, smiled benignly upon a
sleeping world. A gentle breeze whispered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
midnight gossip to the nodding tree-tops.
Man and his restless passions seemed out of
place in such surroundings. But suddenly
upon Bennett’s astonished sight broke a vision
that drove from his mind all idea of nature’s
benignity and concentrated his thought
upon the diabolical activity of man.</p>

<p>As if by magic, the castle seemed to be
surrounded by dark forms moving hither and
thither with a certain military precision.
They appeared to come from the forest and
to obey the will of some leader who had
carefully matured his plans. Bennett opened
the casement and leaned forward. He could
hear the distant words of command and the
subdued tramp of marching men. That he
was wide awake he knew, but the inexplicable
scene before him caused him for an instant
to question his own sanity.</p>

<p>“Ha, you doubt my word?” whispered a
rasping voice at the American’s elbow. “You
imperil precious lives because, forsooth, you
will not look upon the jester as a friend.
Herr Bennett, let me tell you you are madder
than your servant, Cousin Fritz.”</p>

<p>The dwarf chuckled with raucous merriment
at his grim joke. Then he seized Bennett’s
arm and drew him away from the
window.</p>

<p>“There is no time to lose,” whispered the
dwarf excitedly. “The king will not listen
to reason. He refuses to admit that his
crown, his castle, his very life are in peril at
this hour. Come with me and tell him what
you saw from yonder window. Then throw
him a hand at poker for life or death, eh?
We must be gay, Herr Bennett, even though
Brother Wilhelm has placed his hand upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
our sceptre and would hurl us from the
throne. We must be gay, nicht wahr?”</p>

<p>In another moment Bennett and his madcap
guide were hastening toward King Rudolph’s
audience chamber.</p>

<p>“The Princess Hilda, and two or three of
the king’s most loyal gentlemen you will
find here,” said the dwarf, as they approached
the king’s apartments. “I want you to persuade
my Cousin Rudolph that he is backing
a bobtailed flush against a full house. Isn’t
that correct, Herr Bennett? A bobtailed flush
against a full house?”</p>

<p>“But what is your plan,” asked Bennett feverishly.
“Is this really an armed effort to
dethrone the king?”</p>

<p>“It is indeed—an effort armed to the teeth.
You and I, Herr Bennett, are the only loyal
subjects left at this moment to Rudolph XII.,
one hour ago king of Hesse-Heilfels. I have
been looking for an outbreak for some years
back. I am used to them, Herr Bennett.
During the thousand years I have passed as
the real ruler of Hesse-Heilfels, I have seen
many uprisings of the people, and I have
learned to detect the preliminary symptoms.
Wilhelm has played his cards well. He has
waited until the time was ripe. Now he
‘calls,’ and Rudolph holds no hand.”</p>

<p>“And you, Cousin Fritz?” asked Bennett,
marvelling at the strange creature at his
side.</p>

<p>“And I? I remain true to Rudolph. I can
afford to, Herr Bennett. Am I not, after all,
the eternal king of Hesse-Heilfels? I was
king before the Schwartzburgers came, and
I shall reign when they are gone. I lose
nothing by clinging to Rudolph’s falling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
state. And he has always been kind to
Cousin Fritz! But let us hurry on, Herr
Bennett. Every moment is now of value,
if we would persuade the king that he must
take to flight.”</p>

<p>Bennett stumbled forward through the
dark corridor, clinging to the dwarf’s arm
and wondering vaguely if the night’s adventures
would never come to an end. It
seemed to the American as if he had crowded
into the space of a few brief hours an experience
stolen in some mysterious way from a
year in the life of a mediæval knight-errant.
“We live by thoughts, not years; by heart-throbs,
not in figures on a dial,” he murmured
to himself as they reached the outer
doors of the king’s audience chamber.</p>

<p>A striking tableau met their eyes as they
passed from the gloom of the corridor into
the lighted hall. King Rudolph, pale, dishevelled,
wild-eyed, stood in the centre of
the chamber, gazing helplessly at the two
courtiers who had remained loyal to him on
this night of Brother Wilhelm’s triumph.
The Princess Hilda, her face white, but calm,
stood by his side and seemed to be whispering
words of comfort to the discomfited monarch.</p>

<p>As Rudolph’s eyes rested upon Bennett an
expression of hope crossed his face.</p>

<p>“Is it true, Herr Bennett?” he cried. “Tell
these men they lie. Tell them my castle is
not infested by my brother’s friends! Tell
them they dream wild dreams on a peaceful
summer night. What means this wild scurrying
to and fro? Speak, Herr Bennett.
You, at least have not lost your wits.”</p>

<p>The American strove to catch Hilda’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
eye, but the princess studiously avoided his
gaze.</p>

<p>“Your majesty,” said Bennett solemnly,
“I have seen from my windows a sight that
convinces me you stand in great peril. I
cannot doubt the evidence of my senses.
This may be the end of the nineteenth century,
but there appears to be a middle-age
deviltry going on to-night, and you and I—if
you will pardon my frankness—seem to be
the victims.”</p>

<p>“You blunder there, Herr Bennett,” said
the king, with a touch of dignity that was
worthy of his royal pretensions. “You are
the cause—I am the victim.”</p>

<p>Cousin Fritz had been dancing impatiently
round the room.</p>

<p>“You waste time, Cousin Rudolph,” he
cried recklessly. “You can’t stand here and
put down a revolution by a royal edict. You
don’t hold a card in your hand that is worth
drawing to. Leave the table and the stakes
to the winners and wait for better luck.”</p>

<p>King Rudolph, with a gesture of despair,
turned toward the dwarf.</p>

<p>“Treachery from friends and wisdom from
the mouths of fools! It’s all of a piece! Go
on, Cousin Fritz! What do you suggest?
Your advice is as valuable to-night as that
of the men who have pushed me toward this
precipice.” The king glanced pointedly at
Bennett and the two loyal courtiers who
lurked in the background.</p>

<p>“Your only chance, Cousin Rudolph,” said
the dwarf coolly, stepping forward and bending
his knee with solemn mockery before the
king, “is to follow my guidance. Your
guards have proved false, and within another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
ten minutes the hirelings of Wilhelm will be
at yonder door. What will happen then,
who can say? A brother who would seize
your crown will not hesitate to take your
life. But his lawlessness will not find favor
long with the good people of Hesse-Heilfels.
To-night they follow the lead of evil counsellors.
To-morrow they will see the horror
of their deeds. To-morrow, Cousin Rudolph,
you will again be king in their hearts. To-night
they serve your rival’s schemes.”</p>

<p>“But this is hardly to the point, Cousin
Fritz,” said the king gently. “You may
speak the truth, but to-morrow has not come.
We must act, and act at once.”</p>

<p>“Follow me, then,” cried the dwarf, springing
to his feet and seizing the hand of Princess
Hilda. “Hark! Hear that? They are coming
toward us. Quick now! There is no
time to lose.”</p>

<p>Drawing the princess with him, Cousin
Fritz disappeared behind a heavy curtain
that concealed a portrait of a famous
Schwartzburger, who had held the throne of
Hesse-Heilfels nearly two centuries ago.
When King Rudolph, Bennett, and the two
courtiers drew the curtain aside, the portrait
had disappeared and a black hole in the wall
met their eyes. Out of the darkness came
the voice of Cousin Fritz.</p>

<p>“Come on! Come on! Don’t stop to draw
cards. This isn’t poker. Do you hear me?
We aren’t playing jack-pots, your majesty.
We’re making history.”</p>

<p>In another instant the curtain had fallen
into place and the audience chamber remained
lonely and silent in the half lights.
Suddenly an uproar outside the heavy doors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
arose and into the room rushed a crowd of
white-faced, eager men.</p>

<p>“Gott im Himmel! where is he?” cried a
hoarse voice. And behind the curtain the
Schwartzburger of other days smiled in the
darkness—and remained silent.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.</h3>

</div>

<p>Cousin Fritz led the way through the impenetrable
darkness, holding the princess by
the arm. Behind them came Bennett, guiding
the king by the sound of the dwarf’s
harsh, insistent voice. Count von Reibach
and Baron Wollenstein, the loyal courtiers,
stumbled along in the rear, muttering impatiently
now and again as they collided with
some obstacle in their course or lost sight in
the gloom of the fugitives in front of them.</p>

<p>“Courage, friends,” cried Cousin Fritz,
cheerfully, “we’ll find a place of safety and
comfort very soon.” He and the princess had
paused to await the approach of their companions.</p>

<p>“We go down these stairs,” explained their
guide, as the four men grouped themselves
behind him. Scratching a match against the
stone wall at his right hand, Cousin Fritz
showed them a flight of steps that seemed
to run downward into the blackness of everlasting
gloom. The Princess Hilda trembled
as if with cold.</p>

<p>“We didn’t come here for burial, Cousin
Fritz,” remarked King Rudolph testily, leaning
forward and gazing into the abyss.</p>

<p>“No, your majesty, you came here to escape
it,” returned the dwarf sarcastically.
He struck another temporary light, and taking
the hand of the princess began to descend
the steps. It required a good deal of courage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
to follow this madcap guide into the
bowels of the earth, but the men behind him
seemed to have no choice in the matter.
For some time past they had obeyed his
orders, and at this juncture there seemed to
be no good reason for rejecting his leadership.
Bennett was the only one of the party
who harbored the slightest distrust of the
dwarf’s loyalty. Circumstances had combined
to prove to him that Cousin Fritz was
worthy of the trust reposed in him, but the
American, suspicious by temperament and
habit, crept down the stone steps into the
chill blackness with great reluctance. He
had grown very weary of the seemingly inexhaustible
resources of the old castle in the
way of unpleasant surprises, and he hesitated
to place himself beyond all possibility of escape
from the antique structure.</p>

<p>There was one circumstance, however, that
gave Bennett unalloyed satisfaction in this
hour of peril and discomfort. The social
barrier between the Princess Hilda and himself
had been broken down at one blow.
They were both fugitives, and, although she
might hold him responsible for the downfall
of King Rudolph, he was, nevertheless, in a
position to be of great service to her in the
crises that were sure to confront them in the
near future. As he caught a glimpse of her
stately figure in the flickering gleam thrown
by a match lighted by the dwarf, as they
reached the bottom of the long stairway, a
sensation of ecstatic triumph thrilled Bennett’s
soul. Down here in the damp depths
of this gigantic cellar there were no kings,
no princesses, no counts, no barons. They
were all adventurers. The equality begotten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
of misfortune had placed the American upon
a new plane, and he rejoiced at the prospect
that opened before his mind’s eye. It would
go hard, indeed, if he could not prove his
fealty to the princess by a method less heroic,
perhaps, but more satisfactory than that
of voluntary banishment. Nevertheless, he
realized that at this moment the princess
looked upon him as a perjured and recreant
knight, no longer worthy of rank on the lists
of chivalry.</p>

<p>“What next, Cousin Fritz?” asked King
Rudolph, puffing heavily and peering anxiously
around him. “We seem to be in the
wine cellar.”</p>

<p>“We are, your majesty,” answered the
dwarf. “We are surrounded by vintages
worth a king’s ransom. Pardon me, your
majesty. I didn’t mean to be personal. But,
follow me a little further, and I will fulfil my
promise regarding your safety and comfort.”</p>

<p>A moment later the fugitives stood in a
large, damp room, in which Cousin Fritz
seemed thoroughly at home. He scurried
about, lighting candles, pushing pieces of
antique furniture toward his guests and keeping
up a running fire of comment on the
honor paid him by a visit from royalty.
Now and then he would drop a sarcastic remark
that suggested to Bennett the line of
thought the dwarf’s mind was pursuing.
Cousin Fritz, monarch of Hesse-Heilfels for
a thousand years, was proving openly at last
that he was more powerful than any temporary
monarch who held the throne in the
eyes of a short-sighted world. Here in his
secret apartments was the real centre of royalty
in Hesse-Heilfels. Could he not afford<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
to let the petty kings up above fret their
lives away while he, to whom a century was
but a single day, reigned undisturbed, but
all-powerful, over the realm they thought
was theirs?</p>

<p>“Your majesty needs repose,” said Cousin
Fritz imperiously, pointing toward an ancient
divan in a distant corner of the room.
“You are out of spirits, out of breath, and
out of danger. Lie down and take your rest.
We have much to do later on, and we must
begin the day fresh from a little sleep.”</p>

<p>King Rudolph gazed blankly at the dwarf.
The deposed monarch seemed to feel the severe
physical exertion he had undergone,
and his breath came and went with painful
effort. He stumbled toward the divan and
stretched himself thereon with a groan. The
princess stood by the side of his rude couch
and gently rubbed the brow from which a
crown had so recently fallen. In a moment
the king had dropped into a restless sleep
and was snoring with a royal indifference to
the comfort of others curiously characteristic
of the Schwartzburgers.</p>

<p>Cousin Fritz deferentially approached the
Princess Hilda, and, taking her hand, led her
to a corner of the room that lay deep in
shadow. Pulling aside a heavy, moth-eaten
curtain, the dwarf pointed to an inner and
smaller room and said:</p>

<p>“Your apartment awaits you, princess. In
the hurry of our departure I forgot to summon
one of your women to attend you. I
will repair this oversight at once, however.
I hope you will forgive my carelessness.”</p>

<p>A sad smile played across the wan face of
the princess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>“I need no assistance, Cousin Fritz,” she
said gently. “Do not risk your life for my
sake. You must not return to my apartments.”</p>

<p>The dwarf laughed gayly. “I go and come
as the humor sways me,” he said proudly,
“and no man says me nay. Sleep for a time,
sweet princess, and when you awake you will
find a woman by your side. Aufwiedersehen,
and may you sleep well.”</p>

<p>He dropped the curtain and skipped lightly
toward von Reibach and Wollenstein, who
stood in deep converse in one corner of the
room, glancing furtively now and then at
Bennett, who was seated in a chair near the
centre of the apartment, moodily reviewing
the startling events of the long night.</p>

<p>“You will do me the honor, gentlemen,”
said the dwarf cordially, but with a note of
command in his voice, “you will do me the
honor of making yourselves comfortable for
a time. You will find these old couches
fitted for an early morning nap. As for me,
I must return to the upper halls.”</p>

<p>Bennett overheard the dwarf’s final words.
They reawakened his slumbering suspicion.
As the count and baron, acting upon the hint
thrown out to them by their host, prepared
themselves for sleep in a shadow-haunted
alcove, he strode up to Cousin Fritz. Placing
his hand upon the dwarf’s shoulder, he said:</p>

<p>“You are about to return to the upper part
of the castle. I go with you, my friend.”</p>

<p>A mocking smile played across the unsymmetrical
face of the dwarf. He read Bennett’s
mind at a glance.</p>

<p>“As you will, Herr Bennett. My advice
to you would be to get a little sleep while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
you may, but your company on an expedition
that is not without some slight peril
would be a pleasure and a comfort to me.
Come, then, there is no time to lose.”</p>

<p>They had hardly passed from the room into
the gloom of the cellar when a thought
crossed Bennett’s mind that caused him to
seize the dwarf’s arm and hold him motionless
for a moment.</p>

<p>“These men,” he whispered, “why have
they remained loyal to the king? Count von
Reibach first. Why does he cling to Rudolph’s
fallen fortunes?”</p>

<p>Cousin Fritz chuckled silently. Then he
answered in low, rasping tones:</p>

<p>“Von Reibach is a ruined man. He has
lost his all at poker, and fears to face his
creditors.”</p>

<p>“And Baron Wollenstein?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Wollenstein,” answered the dwarf,
“Wollenstein is in love with the Princess
Hilda.”</p>

<p>“The devil you say!” muttered Bennett
profanely. Suddenly he seized the dwarf’s
hand in a grip of iron.</p>

<p>“Tell me, man, why do you leave us here
at this time?”</p>

<p>Cousin Fritz uttered an exclamation of
anger, and attempted to withdraw his hand
from the American’s grip.</p>

<p>“Gott im Himmel, Herr Bennett, why do
you distrust me?” he asked petulantly.
“You’re the shortest-sighted clever man I
ever knew. I’m about to run some risk, if
you must know it, in order to bring back a
waiting-woman for the princess. I made a
miscalculation, and must atone for it. Are
you satisfied?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>A hot flush rose to Bennett’s cheeks, who
felt ashamed of the injustice he had done to
the loyal little man at his side.</p>

<p>“Go then,” he exclaimed cordially, “and
forgive me, Cousin Fritz, for my impertinence.
Hereafter I shall trust you fully.
As for me, I think it best that I should return
to your rooms. Do you understand
me?”</p>

<p>“I think I do, Herr Bennett,” answered the
dwarf, laughing mockingly as he disappeared
in the darkness.</p>

<p>The American turned and groped his way
toward the room he had just left. He opened
the heavy door softly. The candles in the
grim apartment were still lighted, but heavy
shadows danced blackly here and there as
the flames wavered in the draught. Bennett
glanced around the apartment apprehensively.
Suddenly from a distant corner two figures
made toward him hurriedly. He realized
instinctively that the count and baron
had been plotting his destruction.</p>

<p>Closing the door behind him he leaned
against it, and drawing his revolver from his
hip pocket held the weapon in front of him.
The flickering candle-light was reflected by
the gleaming steel.</p>

<p>“Hold hard, my friends,” said Bennett
coolly, “a step farther in my direction means
a bullet for the man who makes it.”</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

</div>

<p>Bennett’s face was pale but smiling as
he witnessed the dismay of his baffled foes.
That his possession of a pistol at this crisis
had saved his life he had not the slightest
doubt. The count hated him because he had
introduced poker into the kingdom; the
baron, with the jealous eyes of a lover, saw
in the American a possible rival for the favor
of the princess. Furthermore, the courtiers
realized, doubtless, that if they were captured
in the company of the American their
chance of winning pardon from Wilhelm, the
successful usurper, would be slight.</p>

<p>All this passed through Bennett’s mind as
he leaned against the great door and pointed
his weapon first at the count and then at the
baron, taking a mischievous pleasure in their
not unnatural disquietude. Hardly a sound
broke the stillness. A rat gnawed noisily
somewhere in the woodwork. The asthmatic
breathing of the deposed king could be
heard, irregular and ominous.</p>

<p>Suddenly a swishing of skirts startled Bennett
and his foiled assailants, and the Princess
Hilda, white and anxious, stood between
them. The American returned his revolver
to his pocket and folded his arms silently.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” asked the Princess
sternly, turning from one to another of
the trio. “Is it not enough that we are
driven like rats into a hole? Why should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
you quarrel? Herr Bennett, why have you
threatened the lives of these men? Are they
not unarmed? And you stand there, like a
highwayman, pointing a pistol at their heads.
Speak, sir! Have you nothing to say?”</p>

<p>Bennett’s face, flushed at first, had grown
white and drawn.</p>

<p>“I have nothing to say, your royal highness,”
he answered in a low voice.</p>

<p>Count von Reibach and Baron Wollenstein
gazed at the American in amazement. His
generosity was inexplicable.</p>

<p>The Princess Hilda stood silent for a time,
plunged in deep thought. Then she said
firmly:</p>

<p>“Give me your revolver, Herr Bennett.”</p>

<p>He removed the weapon from his pocket
and placed it carefully in her outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>“A wasp is harmless without his sting,”
muttered the baron under his breath. Count
von Reibach, more generous than his colleague,
placed his hand upon the latter’s
mouth and whispered to him to remain silent.</p>

<p>The Princess Hilda had retreated toward
her apartment. Before she dropped the curtain
she turned and looked at the little group
behind her. In one hand she held the pistol,
while with the other she drew the curtains
aside. The picture that she made at that
moment in the flickering light, with the fitful
gleams playing on her golden hair, while
heavy shadows behind her threw the outlines
of her tall figure into strong relief, Bennett
never forgot. Suddenly she dropped the
curtain and disappeared. The deep gloom
of the apartment seemed to return on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
instant, and the American turned sadly toward
his foes. Deprived of weapon, he had
determined to sell his life, if the struggle
were forced upon him, as dearly as he might.
To his astonishment, however, he saw Count
von Reibach approaching him with an outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>“You are a gentleman, Herr Bennett,” said
the count cordially, “in spite of the fact that
you go to extremes.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="la">Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes</i>,” muttered
Bennett coldly, not accepting the count’s
hand. “You must acknowledge, sir, that by
going to extremes I took the only course
open to me at the moment.”</p>

<p>Count von Reibach smiled grimly. “The
fact is, Herr Bennett, that we had formed
no diabolical design, the baron and myself.
For certain reasons—reasons of state, as our
unhappy king would say—we felt that your
presence here was inopportune, and we had
decided to—to——”</p>

<p>“Assassinate me,” remarked Bennett curtly.</p>

<p>“Not at all. You do us grave injustice, I
assure you. It is just possible that, had you
not checked our impetuosity at the right moment,
we might have imprisoned you in an
empty wine-cask somewhere in the cellar, but
we had no wish to take your life. The Count
von Reibach and Baron Wollenstein are not
cut-throats, Herr Bennett. And let me assure
you we appreciate your generosity in
refusing to accuse us to the princess.”</p>

<p>The Baron Wollenstein had listened sullenly
to his comrade’s rather lame apology.
He gazed with stubborn enmity at Bennett,
and then said to the count:</p>

<p>“Come, von Reibach, let’s get some sleep.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
The fact is. I’m <i lang="de">ausgespielt</i>. As for this—gentleman,
let me assure him that we have no
further intention of interfering with his liberty.
Come, count.”</p>

<p>The two courtiers retired toward a dark
corner of the room, not far from the entrance
to Princess Hilda’s apartment. Here they
stretched themselves upon a dilapidated
piece of furniture that had once served as
a regal couch for a reigning Schwartzburger.
Bennett could hear their guttural voices as
they talked together in low tones for a time.
Then silence, broken only by the king’s labored
breathing and the occasional snores of
the exhausted courtiers, reigned in the old
lumber-room, made barely habitable by
Cousin Fritz’s efforts.</p>

<p>The Princess Hilda, upon her return to the
inner room, had thrown herself fully dressed
upon the improvised bed prepared for her by
the dwarf, and had vainly attempted to forget
her woes in sleep. The horrors of her
situation forced themselves persistently upon
her mind and the events of a long and dreadful
day allied themselves in opposition to
peaceful slumber. It seemed an age since
she had stood beside King Rudolph in the
morning and had attempted to impress him
with the seriousness of the crisis that confronted
them. The downfall of her uncle,
and their undignified flight, had occurred
with such suddenness that she had not yet
been able to grasp their full significance.
Then a strange, inexplicable feeling stole
over her and she realized, with a sensation
of shame, that in this dark hour she took
comfort in the presence of Herr Bennett.
Annoyed by this discovery, she turned restlessly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
upon her pillow and again attempted
to forget her woes and weariness in sleep.</p>

<p>The lower regions of the castle of the
Schwartzburgers were not wholly under the
control of Cousin Fritz. His sway was disputed
by the rats, liberty-loving creatures
having no respect for the rights of property
nor reverence for royalty. A rat-hole, running
clear through the wall, opened like a
speaking-tube just where the shapely ear of
the Princess Hilda rested as she lay quiet,
fervently praying for sleep. Suddenly her
wandering thoughts were recalled from the
borderland of oblivion by the stern realities
of her surroundings. She heard distinctly
the guttural voice of Baron Wollenstein as
he said to Count von Reibach:</p>

<p>“You are too soft-hearted, Count. Our
only safety lies in Herr Bennett’s death.
Mark my words, it is his life or ours in the
end. This is no time for gentle deeds and
kindly words. We’ll be captured in this
hole, as sure as Wilhelm reigns. If we kill
Bennett and conceal his body, we can prove
to Wilhelm that we followed Rudolph in the
interest of the new <i lang="fr">régime</i>. Verstehen Sie?
Am I not right?”</p>

<p>The horrified princess could not catch the
count’s answer. She strained her ear in
vain, but the rat-hole no longer served her
purpose as an eavesdropper. How long
she lay motionless she knew not, but after
a time the snoring of the conspirators convinced
her that they had ceased their plotting
for a time and were plunged in sleep.</p>

<p>The princess arose softly, grasped the revolver
that she had placed on the floor near
her bed, and stole toward the entrance to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
chamber. As she pulled aside the curtains
and glanced furtively around the larger room
she saw that one candle still burned dimly
in a corner near the main entrance. By its
flickering gleams she could make out the
figure of the exhausted American as he lay,
sprawled in broken slumbers, in an antique
chair near the door through which he expected
the return of Cousin Fritz.</p>

<p>As she approached Bennett a feeling of
mingled tenderness and repentance came
over her. This man had been in peril of his
life, and she had harshly accused him of a
crime. Was it not more than possible that
she had always misjudged him; that he had
found it impracticable to fulfil the oath he
had sworn to her in the Hall of Armor?
Surely he had not promised to leave the
castle before the morning, and the morning,
she imagined, was only just breaking. She
glanced down at his white, clear-cut face,
rendered almost ghastly by the dim light in
contrast with his black, luxuriant hair.</p>

<p>“Herr Bennett,” she whispered gently,
bending forward and placing a hand upon
his shoulder. He awoke on the instant and
their eyes met.</p>

<p>“Take your pistol,” she said simply. “You
are still in grave danger. I did you an injustice.”</p>

<p>He had sprung to his feet, a mournful
smile playing across his face.</p>

<p>“Your royal highness,” he said, “I thank
you from my heart—not for the weapon but
for your words.”</p>

<p>A flush arose to her cheeks and there came
into her eyes a light as sweet as the dawn
that drove the shadows from the hills outside.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.</h3>

</div>

<p>The Princess Hilda opened her eyes
wearily. She had slept for several hours,
but her first sensation as she woke was one
of utter misery. Sleep had brought with it
no refreshment, no exhilaration. The mere
joy of living, that so often thrilled her in the
morning, she seemed to have lost forever.
The twilight that reigned in this subterranean
apartment, the sudden recollection of
the grim disasters of the previous day, the
discomfort that resulted from sleeping fully
dressed, and the sensation of utter loneliness
that came over her, combined to render her
awakening painful. She turned impatiently
upon her couch. Suddenly a smile of joy
lighted her sad face. Fraulein Müller, her favorite
attendant, a plump, red-cheeked young
woman of twenty, was seated by her side.</p>

<p>“Good morning, your highness,” cried the
maiden cheerily. “You seem glad to see
me.”</p>

<p>“I am indeed,” said the princess warmly.
“This has been, Gretchen, oh, such an awful
night! I feel as if, somehow, my youth
had gone forever; that I shall always be an
old, old woman.”</p>

<p>Fraulein Müller laughed gayly. “It is not
so bad as that, my princess. Lie quiet for
a while and I will make you young again.
See, I have brought with me many things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
that you need. I was heart-broken until
Cousin Fritz, who can crawl through cracks
in the floor or fly through the ceiling, stood
suddenly by my side and told me to dry my
tears and make ready to attend you. There
were wild doings in the castle last night, and
I sat with the other women in your apartments
trembling at the awful sounds we
heard. When Cousin Fritz appeared and
told us that you were safe, we took him in
our arms and kissed him until he kicked and
swore and called us hard names. Then we
dropped the wicked little angel and I got
a few of your things into a bundle and followed
him into the bowels of the earth. It
wasn’t much fun, your highness, to creep
through the darkness with that crazy little
villain at my side, laughing wildly at my
fears and pinching me now and then to hear
me cry out with fright. But when I saw you
lying here alone, I felt that I could hug
Cousin Fritz. His head is queer enough,
but he has a heart of gold.”</p>

<p>As she thus talked on, while she loosened
the Princess Hilda’s hair and brushed out the
golden-brown locks, the feeling of despair
that had come over the royal fugitive departed.
The princess was by temperament
a sanguine, sunny-natured girl, cold and
haughty toward those she could not trust,
but cordially affectionate with her intimates.
Her attendants had been recruited from the
best families in the kingdom, and it was
known throughout Hesse-Heilfels that the
Princess Hilda, in spite of her proud bearing,
was a very lovable creature.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Gretchen,” she said, glancing
anxiously at Fraulein Müller, who was at that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
moment spreading a morning dress upon the
bed, “tell me what has happened up above?
Are the people—my people, as I loved to call
them—really thirsting for my blood?”</p>

<p>Fraulein Müller laughed aloud. She was
one of those rare creatures whose gayety
cannot be suppressed by the most dismal
surroundings.</p>

<p>“It was rumored when I came away, your
royal highness, that your Uncle Wilhelm
was bitterly disappointed at your disappearance.
He is, it is said, anxious to get word
to you that his plans did not include any
change in your status at court. He has
spread abroad the impression that he has
deposed King Rudolph simply to save Hesse-Heilfels
from ruin. He has no intention, it
is reported, of altering your position in the
kingdom. Somebody told me that he had
made the remark that your uncle would still
be king, but sane instead of mad.”</p>

<p>“Hush, Fraulein Müller,” said the princess
sternly. “These walls are not to be trusted—as
I well know—and I would not have King
Rudolph hear what you have just said for
worlds. How little Uncle Wilhelm knows
my heart! King Rudolph has been to me a
father since my childhood. Sane or mad,
king or exile, he deserves my loyalty and
love. Listen, Gretchen! I would die with
Rudolph in this rat-hole sooner than return
to Wilhelm’s court and countenance his
treachery by silent acquiescence. I have
striven to prevent this awful crisis. I have
labored to turn my Uncle Rudolph from his
mad ways. I have failed. But let it not be
said that the Princess Hilda of Hesse-Heilfels
changes her colors with the fortunes of her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
house. If loyalty to Rudolph means imprisonment,
or even death, I shall follow his
banner to the end.”</p>

<p>She stood there, flushed, defiant, beautiful,
her eyes dark with the fervor of her passion;
a girl no longer, for the stern discipline of
evil fortune had made her a woman in a
night. Never again would her heart dance
merrily with the mere gayety of youth. She
had lost something of the precious vivacity
of girlhood, but in its place had come the
strength and firmness that add a touch of
grandeur to maturity.</p>

<p>Fraulein Müller gazed at her mistress with
admiration. Never before had the maiden
she had served seemed so thoroughly a queen
as at this moment when she stood, a fugitive
skulking in a cellar, bereft of everything
that makes royalty impressive, and voiced to
a single listener the noblest sentiments of
loyalty. Above her shone the bright light
of the summer sun, awakening a people who
would gladly welcome her return to the pomp
and state that had been hers throughout her
life. Above her reigned a king who would
place her by his side and reward her allegiance
to his cause with power and dominion.
In contrast with all this, what was offered
her? An existence of wretched discomfort
in the damp darkness of a rat-haunted chamber.
A miserable present and an uncertain
future. The companionship of ruined men,
of a king whose crazy folly had hurled him
from the pinnacle of power into the abysmal
depths of despair and ruin. Here was a girl
of eighteen, upon whom nature had lavished
all her gifts, and to whom the world bowed
down in loving homage, confronted by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
choice from which the boldest man would
have shrunk back in dismay. And the Princess
Hilda gave up the sunshine for the darkness,
the light of day for the gloom of night,
the pleasures of the gladsome world for the
grim shadows of a living tomb! Is it strange
that in Hesse-Heilfels you should hear it said
that in the Schwartzburger blood there is a
strain of heroism that breaks out now and
then, as the generations come and go?</p>

<p>Something of all this passed through Fraulein
Müller’s mind as she gazed at the princess
with eyes that looked upon her royal
mistress with new reverence. She bent forward
and kissed Hilda’s hand with loving
deference. There were tears on the Fraulein’s
cheeks as she smiled up at her mistress,
from whose face the flush of excitement
had departed.</p>

<p>“Ah, Gretchen,” said the princess wearily,
“you must not weep! Surely, nothing can
be gained by tears. But to be a woman is
so hard! How powerless we are! Oh, for a
man’s arm to-day, Gretchen! Were I a prince,
do you know what I would do? If they had
driven me down into this hole, I would find
the powder magazine and blow those rebels
into bits.”</p>

<p>Fraulein Müller laughed merrily. The ludicrous
side of a situation always appealed
first to her mind.</p>

<p>“Would it not be a grim revenge?” she
cried. “But I fear, your highness, we would
not live to enjoy it.”</p>

<p>At that moment a knock at the door recalled
them to the exigencies of the hour.
Fraulein Müller ran merrily toward the entrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>That she and her mistress were not wholly
alone was a reassuring thought.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” she cried, smoothing back
her hair from her brow and rearranging her
skirts. The habits of a court are not quickly
lost, even in a cellar.</p>

<p>“Cousin Fritz, my Lady Müller. An envoy
from the reigning King of Hesse-Heilfels,
Rudolph XII. I crave audience of the Princess
Hilda.”</p>

<p>Fraulein Müller, smiling at the madcap’s
pompous words, threw back the door. The
dwarf instantly rushed in, turned quickly and
pinched her arm with mischievous force, and
then hurried forward, to throw himself upon
one knee before the princess, the feather of
his jaunty cap trailing on the floor.</p>

<p>“Your royal highness,” said he ceremoniously,
his harsh voice penetrating to the
furthest corners of the room. “Your liege
lord, the King of Hesse-Heilfels, commends
himself to you with loving words and commands
your immediate presence in the dining-hall.
Such is the message he ordered
me to give you. Personally let me add,
your royal highness, that this morning we
draw to a full larder, and, if your appetite
is good, I should advise you to take a hand
in the game.”</p>

<p>The Princess Hilda could not restrain a
smile at the dwarf’s words, but she felt a
pang of annoyance at hearing again the
poker jargon that had become synonymous,
to her mind, with ruin and disgrace.</p>

<p>“Tell the king, Cousin Fritz,” she said,
rising and moving toward the door, “that I
will be with him at once.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.</h3>

</div>

<p>Wilhelm IX., King of Hesse-Heilfels by
the divine right of grand larceny, gazed from
a window in the castle at the rising sun; emblematic,
as he reflected, of himself and his
fortunes. He was a younger, better built
man than his brother, Rudolph the Deposed.
His legs were much longer than his brother’s,
thus making his head cooler. There was an
old saying in Hesse-Heilfels to the effect that
“a Schwartzburger with short legs always
toddles into trouble.” His superiority in
length of limb had had much to do toward
rendering Wilhelm’s usurpation successful.
The impressionable and somewhat superstitious
people of Hesse-Heilfels possessed an
hereditary conviction that the longer the legs
of a Schwartzburger the better fitted he was
to rule the kingdom. When, therefore, it was
whispered that Wilhelm plotted to seize the
sceptre the Heilfelsans were drawn irresistibly
to his cause. They preferred a long-legged
Schwartzburger, of good habits, as king, to
a short-legged gambler who was over-fond of
wine.</p>

<p>Wilhelm’s face, pale and drawn from the
stress of an exciting night, wore a smile of
triumph as he looked forth upon the picturesque
domain that he had so easily made his
own. Backed by the people of Hesse-Heilfels,
and sure of recognition at Berlin, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
felt that he was safely seated upon a throne
that he had long wished to occupy. Presently
he turned from the window, and beckoned
to a man who had recently entered the
room and stood awaiting the pleasure of
royalty.</p>

<p>“What news, Herr Schmidt?” asked Wilhelm
eagerly, “is there any clew to my lost
relatives? My brother can’t perform miracles.
He must be concealed somewhere
in the castle.”</p>

<p>“We have searched the building from top
to bottom, your majesty, but can find no
trace of Rudolph, the Princess, nor the
Yankee. But a strange story has come from
the Princess Hilda’s waiting-women. How
much truth there is in it, I do not know.”</p>

<p>“We’ll find out at first hand,” said King
Wilhelm, seating himself in a chair by the
side of a small round table. “Summon all
her women to my presence.”</p>

<p>Herr Schmidt hurried from the room.</p>

<p>“Carl Eingen, a word with you,” said Wilhelm,
and the handsome baritone approached
the king and deferentially bent the knee.</p>

<p>“As I understand it,” said Wilhelm, “the
capture of this American adventurer was
left to you, Carl Eingen. Why did you fail
to obey orders?”</p>

<p>The tall youth turned pale, but answered
firmly:</p>

<p>“The failure cannot be laid at my door,
your majesty. I obeyed in detail the instructions
I received. The weak spot in our
scheme lay in the fact that we put too little
stress upon the cleverness of Cousin Fritz.”</p>

<p>“Cousin Fritz?” cried the king in astonishment.
“The madcap dwarf? Surely he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
could not have foiled you all! What had
he to do with the affair?”</p>

<p>“An hour or so before we made the general
advance upon the castle, your majesty,
Cousin Fritz was seen—I saw him myself—dancing
wildly on the balcony in front of the
American’s apartment. The dwarf is the
only man in the kingdom who knows all the
underground secrets of this ancient castle. I
have no doubt that he has led Rudolph and the
rest to a place of, at least, temporary secrecy.”</p>

<p>“Just who are missing, Herr Eingen?”
asked Wilhelm.</p>

<p>“Rudolph, the Princess Hilda, Baron Wollenstein,
Count von Reibach, Herr Bennett,
and Cousin Fritz.”</p>

<p>“That is all?”</p>

<p>“So far as I can learn, no one else has disappeared
from the castle since our entrance.”</p>

<p>“It is strange,” mused the usurper. “So
large a party, it seems to me, could not vanish
in one instant without leaving some clew
behind them. You say, Herr Eingen, that
the cellars have been thoroughly explored?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your majesty. I led the exploring
party myself. There is, beneath this castle,
a labyrinth of passages, cellars, dungeons,
and lumber rooms that taxed our patience
severely, but we groped into every nook and
corner, and found nothing to reward our
search.”</p>

<p>At this moment Herr Schmidt returned,
followed by a group of young women whom
the events of the night had rendered hysterical.
At a sign from Wilhelm, Herr Schmidt
led his bevy of distraught maidens toward
the usurper.</p>

<p>“Now understand me,” said Wilhelm sternly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
“I shall imprison you in a body if you all
insist upon talking at once. Furthermore, I
object to tears. You have nothing to cry
about if you will obey your king. Do you
comprehend me? Your king, Wilhelm IX.,
by the grace of God monarch of Hesse-Heilfels.
You there, in front, answer my questions!
What is this wonderful tale that I
hear has been spread abroad from your corner
of the castle?”</p>

<p>Carl Eingen, his countenance disturbed,
was anxiously glancing from face to face of
the trembling women, seeking some one he
could not find. In answer to Wilhelm, a
maiden standing nearer to royalty than the
others said, her voice tremulous with emotion:</p>

<p>“This morning, your majesty, about four
o’clock, Cousin Fritz suddenly appeared, as
if by magic, among us. He ordered us to
make a bundle of things most necessary for
the Princess Hilda’s comfort. Then he went
away, accompanied by her royal highness’
favorite attendant.”</p>

<p>Carl Eingen gazed at the speaker earnestly,
while Wilhelm said:</p>

<p>“Her favorite attendant? Who may that
be?”</p>

<p>“The Fraulein Müller, your majesty.”</p>

<p>Carl Eingen’s face turned white. He had
long loved Fraulein Müller, and her non-attendance
upon Wilhelm had filled him with
dismay. “Weren’t you in the cellars at that
hour, Herr Eingen?” asked Wilhelm sternly.</p>

<p>“I was, your majesty—with twenty men
with torches.”</p>

<p>“And you heard no sound—no footsteps—no
echoes?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>“None, your majesty, that the vastness of
the vaults would not explain.”</p>

<p>The usurper sat silent for a time, deep in
thought. Now and again one of the waiting-women
would sob hysterically. Carl Eingen’s
impatience grew apace. He longed for
action, for some physical outlet for the anxiety
that oppressed him. He had seen little
of Fraulein Müller since she had been taken
into the household of the Princess Hilda, but
his boyhood had been spent in her companionship.
He could not remember the time
when he had not loved her. Her bright face
and sunny nature had been to him for years
a solace and a hope. That she had been
lured into the perils that surrounded the path
of the royal fugitives, he could not now
doubt. The conviction filled him with dismay.
He longed to begin at once a renewal
of the fruitless search he had made in the
early morning. He watched the changing
expressions on Wilhelm’s face anxiously.
Presently the usurper spoke:</p>

<p>“Come here, Herr Schmidt,” said Wilhelm,
a cruel tone in his deep voice. “Seat yourself
at this table and write as I direct. Are
you ready? Go on then. ‘To the people
of Hesse-Heilfels, greeting: I, Wilhelm IX.,
by the grace of God king of Hesse-Heilfels,
do call upon you to render up to me, dead
or alive, the person of one Cousin Fritz, a
dwarf, who has held, under my predecessor,
the office of Court Jester. To the man or
men who shall bring to my castle the body
of said Cousin Fritz shall be paid the sum of
five hundred marks. Given under my hand
and seal, at the castle of Heilfels, this tenth
day of August, 189—.’ There, I think that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
may be effective in crushing out the last
sparks of rebellion in this afflicted land.
Have a hundred copies of that proclamation
made at once, Herr Schmidt. See to it that
they are exposed in every wine-shop in the
kingdom. Take a few of them, Herr Eingen,
and affix them to the walls in the most
remote corners of the cellars under us. Oh,
one moment, Herr Schmidt; add to the proclamation
that a full pardon will be granted
to any one who has been in rebellion against
Wilhelm IX., in case he aids in the capture
of Cousin Fritz. That may have an effect
upon Reibach and Wollenstein, if they should
see the notice. As I remember them, those
two men are among the worst products
of Brother Rudolph’s worm-eaten vineyard.
And now, gentlemen, let us break our fast.
Ladies, I bid you good-morning. It is my
fondest hope that you may have your mistress
with you again at the earliest possible
moment.”</p>

<p>Wilhelm arose and the audience was at an
end. With a heavy heart, Carl Eingen joined
Herr Schmidt and prepared for another descent
to the weird regions beneath the castle.
Meanwhile the people of Hesse-Heilfels had
begun the day under a new <i lang="fr">régime</i>, and the
whisper went abroad throughout the kingdom
that indulgence in the game of draw-poker
would be construed as the crime of <i lang="fr">lese
majesté</i>.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.</h3>

</div>

<p>Carl Eingen had searched, as he believed,
the most remote corner of the wine-cellar.
He had taken with him no companion upon
his subterranean bill-posting expedition, and,
courageous though he was, he could not control
a feeling of nervous discomfort as he
fastened the grewsome proclamation of King
Wilhelm to what he imagined was the last
outpost in this tortuous hole in the ground.
He had affixed type-written copies offering a
reward for the capture of Cousin Fritz, dead
or alive, to wine casks, stone walls, and
wooden pillars in various parts of the cellar,
and he breathed a sigh of relief at the
thought that his grim task was at an end.
Suddenly a harsh, shrill voice, just above his
head, cried out:</p>

<p>“Ha Carl Eingen, I’m worth five hundred
marks, eh? I’ll throw you double or
quits for my body. What say you?”</p>

<p>Carl started in affright, and dropped the
hammer he held in his hand. Perched upon
a huge hogshead sat Cousin Fritz, his feathered
cap upon his head, smiling down mischievously
at the astonished youth.</p>

<p>“Will you come up and take me?” asked
the dwarf maliciously, moving his short
sword in the air and then making a few defiant
passes at his antagonist. “Do you need
money, Carl? Five hundred marks! It is a
large sum.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>Carl Eingen remained silent, but he could
not suppress a smile as the ludicrous features
of the situation impressed him. Suddenly the
dwarf’s mood changed.</p>

<p>“You’re a good fellow, Carl Eingen, in
spite of your rebellious nature,” he said
gently. “I don’t believe you’d murder me
in cold blood. That’s more than I could say
of several men I know. As times go, Carl,
it’s high praise.”</p>

<p>“I think, Cousin Fritz,” said Carl quietly,
“that you’d better come with me without
more ado. You’re sure to be captured down
here and you might be run to earth by somebody
who would think it less trouble to take
you dead than alive. I promise you that I’ll
do my best to make easy terms for you with
the king.”</p>

<p>“What king, Carl?” asked the dwarf mockingly.
“You may not know it, but I am the
real, the only king of Hesse-Heilfels. In the
long run I dictate my own terms—and they
are always accepted, Carl Eingen. Do you
call Brother Wilhelm king? Nonsense! He’s
only an upstart who struts about up above
for a time and then falls to sleep like the
rest. Hesse-Heilfels has only one king—and
he never dies. But enough of this, Carl! I
won’t come to you and you can’t capture me.
Nevertheless, I prefer you as an ally to a foe.
I’ll make you a proposition.”</p>

<p>Carl Eingen frowned and strode nervously
up and down, almost within reach of the
dwarf’s pointed shoes. He felt absurdly conscious
of his momentary impotence. He was
keenly alive to the possibility that he would
be obliged to return to Wilhelm and confess
that he had been outwitted by the dwarf.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
Furthermore, Cousin Fritz was in possession
of a secret that Carl Eingen longed to solve.
Upon the hogshead above him sat the captor
of Fraulein Müller, and her lover burned to
get word of her. He knew, right well, that
only by diplomacy could he make Cousin
Fritz reveal the truth concerning her abduction.</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Carl smoothly, “let me hear
your proposition, Cousin Fritz.”</p>

<p>The dwarf chuckled with inward merriment.
Then he bent forward, his hand still
upon his sword, and said:</p>

<p>“You think me mad, Carl Eingen, but
you’d do well to back my hand at this crisis
in the game. In this case one king beats a
royal flush. I’m the king, and I know my
power. Let me tell you, Carl Eingen, that
you will never see again a face that you love
nor hear a voice that has grown dear to you
unless you heed what I shall say. It has
come to a contest between your loyalty and
your love. If you remain true to Wilhelm,
you will be false to your love. If you place
your mistress above your king in your heart,
you must forswear Wilhelm. Do you follow
me?”</p>

<p>There was a sane intensity in the dwarf’s
manner that Carl Eingen had never observed
before. It impressed him even more than
the madcap’s words.</p>

<p>“And if I abandon Wilhelm, Cousin Fritz?”
asked Carl earnestly.</p>

<p>“You shall see your love again, Carl Eingen.”</p>

<p>“And otherwise?”</p>

<p>“The sweet face of Gretchen Müller shall
smile upon you only from the shadows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
of the night, when memory haunts your
pillow and drives sleep routed from your
couch.”</p>

<p>Carl Eingen looked about him restlessly.
The dark mysteries of this weird cellar appeared
to cast upon him an uncanny spell.
He seemed to be plunged into a shadow-haunted
realm in which laws that were new
to him prevailed. The dwarf, smiling with
conscious power, seemed to exert a hypnotic
influence over the impressionable youth,
whose artistic sensibilities rendered him extremely
sensitive to the influences of a romantic
environment.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the threat uttered by the
dwarf had had its effect. Carl Eingen longed
passionately to gaze once more upon a face
that had been for years the fairest sight earth
held for him. The possibility—remote and
unreasonable as it seemed—that this little
mischief-maker could remove Gretchen Müller
forever from his ken thrilled him with
unspeakable dread. Instinctively he seemed
to realize that Cousin Fritz was not wholly
a vain boaster, that he was not without some
portion of the boundless power he claimed.</p>

<p>“Well, Cousin Fritz,” said Carl at length,
his voice hoarse and unsteady, “I will go to
this point, and no further. If you will lead
me at once to Fraulein Müller, I give you
my word that I will take no advantage of
what I have learned, that neither Wilhelm
nor any of his people shall know that I have
met you down here.”</p>

<p>The dwarf laughed mockingly and sprang
to the floor. “It’s unconditional surrender,
even on those terms,” he cried. “What I
have left undone, Fraulein Müller will accomplish.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
Look here, Carl Eingen! See
how powerless you were.”</p>

<p>Cousin Fritz skipped merrily toward the
proclamation that offered a reward for his
capture. Removing it from the wall he playfully
tore it into small pieces. Suddenly, to
Carl’s amazement, a black hole gaped at
them where the paper had rested but a
moment before.</p>

<p>“In here, Carl,” cried the dwarf, scrambling
through the aperture. “You thought
you had reached the end of the cellar. This
is merely the entrance, my friend.”</p>

<p>For a moment the youth hesitated. When,
after much squeezing and a good deal of discomfort,
he stood beside Cousin Fritz, his
guide’s figure was almost lost in the deep
gloom.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said the dwarf, seizing Carl’s
hand. “We have not far to go; we are taking
a short cut to my apartments—the real
centre of royalty in Hesse-Heilfels.”</p>

<p>A moment later they stepped out into a
passageway that soon led them to the main
entrance of the rooms in which the dwarf
had ensconced Rudolph XI. and his small
suite. Cautiously opening the heavy door,
Cousin Fritz tightly gripped Carl Eingen’s
arm and silently pointed to the scene before
them.</p>

<p>In the centre of the hall the deposed king
was seated at a table, at the opposite side of
which Count von Reibach shuffled a pack of
cards. Between them were small piles of
pebbles that roughly served as chips. Baron
Wollenstein, with a surly expression upon
his heavy face, appeared to watch the game,
but his restless eyes constantly turned toward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
a group at the farther corner of the room.
The Princess Hilda, attended by Fraulein
Müller, was seated in an antique chair of
state, against the back of which her head
rested as she gazed upward at Herr Bennett.
The American, oblivious of the threatening
glances of Baron Wollenstein, was bending
forward talking earnestly to the golden-haired
princess. A smile played across her
face as she listened to his words.</p>

<p>“There, Carl Eingen,” whispered the dwarf
mischievously, “is the game as it stands.
Will you draw cards?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the youth hoarsely as he
met the eye of Fraulein Müller, who turned
white with amazement as she caught sight of
him.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.</h3>

</div>

<p>There was nothing in the topic upon which
Bennett was discoursing to the Princess Hilda
to arouse the jealousy of Baron Wollenstein.
The American was speaking eloquently, but
impersonally, of his native land. The events
of the night and the ominous inaction of the
morning had rendered the princess a willing
listener to the voice of a man to whom, she
felt, she had shown great injustice. Woman-like,
having reached the conclusion that she
had not treated him with fairness, she now
went to the extreme of trusting Bennett
fully. Her discovery of the utter baseness
of Wollenstein and von Reibach added to the
longing she felt to prove that the American
was not unworthy of her regard.</p>

<p>“It is true,” said Bennett smilingly, “that
my beautiful country is not made picturesque
by antique castles, but, your Royal
Highness, you must admit that I have no
cause to hold it in contempt for that reason.”
He glanced around the gloomy apartment
meaningly.</p>

<p>The princess understood him, and her eyes
were sympathetic as they met his. “But an
old castle has its advantages,” she remarked,
with forced gayety. “It is crystallized history,
is it not? Furthermore, it may offer a
place of refuge in time of trouble.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Bennett, loyal to his American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
prejudices, “that is just the point. In my
country, we need no underground cellars to
escape the wrath of man. We use them for
another purpose. But don’t think me narrow-minded,
Your Highness. I appreciate
the advantages your country offers to the
tourist, to the lover of romance, but, as a
place of residence, I must admit that I prefer
Litchfield County to Hesse-Heilfels.”</p>

<p>The Princess Hilda sat silent for a moment.
Her mind dwelt upon the ruin this
man had wrought in the land she loved.
She had been forced to the conclusion that
the disaster he had brought to Hesse-Heilfels
had been the outcome not of malice, but of
mischance. Nevertheless, he had been the
motive force, at the outset, that had overthrown
the <i lang="fr">régime</i> of which she was a part.
How far was it becoming for her to accept
his friendship? She could not answer. Of
her own free-will she had thrown down the
barrier between them, and it was too late,
perhaps, to reconstruct it.</p>

<p>The Princess Hilda was only eighteen
years of age. The full significance of the
political revolution of which she was a victim
had not yet come to her. Had she possessed
a wider and deeper experience of the
ways of the world, the embarrassments that
surrounded her would have impressed her
more deeply. But she was very young, and,
it is the peril and the privilege of youth to
make light of difficulties that appear insuperable
to the eyes of maturity. Furthermore,
the princess was undergoing a novel experience
that possessed for her a dangerous fascination.
The rigid etiquette of the old-fashioned
court in which she had spent her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
girlhood had precluded the possibility of
frank and sympathetic intercourse with young
men. An American girl of eighteen is apt
to be as wise as a serpent, though harmless
as a dove. She is sure of herself. She takes
pride in the conviction that she understands
men. What she has failed to learn of the
peculiarities of human nature from experience,
she has derived from literature and the
drama. She makes her <i lang="fr">début</i> in society a
full-fledged woman of the world. If she is
clever, her epigrams are as pointed at eighteen
as they will be at twenty-eight.</p>

<p>But a German princess develops more
slowly. She is hedged around by safeguards
erected on the theory that there should be
no royal road to worldliness. She is moulded
by ceremonies and fashioned by precedents.
She is deprived by birth of the divine
right to choose a husband. At eighteen she
has become merely a more or less ornamental
piece in a royal game of chess. The
American girl of the same age is years older
than the German princess.</p>

<p>Let it not be imagined, however, that
Jonathan Edwards Bennett found the Princess
Hilda of Hesse-Heilfels too young and
unsophisticated to be interesting. While her
recent experiences may not have assumed in
her mind their ultimate significance, they
had had, nevertheless, a marked effect in
changing her mental attitude toward many
subjects. At one blow she had been thrust
into an entirely new relationship to the universe
at large. Heretofore, she had been led
to believe that the sun rose and set merely
for her own royal pleasure and profit. Suddenly
even the light of that luminary had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
been denied to her. The immediate effect
of this deprivation had been educational. For
the first time in her life she had been brought
face to face with the fact that royalty itself
is subject to the chastisement that fate so
freely bestows upon lesser mortals.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Herr Bennett,” she said after a
time, glancing significantly at the poker-players
in the centre of the room, “what will
be the outcome of all this? We can’t live
here all our days. I should become an old
woman in a year if I could never see the sun,
never hear the wind among the trees.”</p>

<p>A smile played across her shapely mouth,
but her eyes were sad as they looked up at
the pale, handsome face above her.</p>

<p>“Do you know, your royal highness,” said
Bennett, lowering his voice, confidentially,
“I have come to the conclusion that the solution
of the puzzle rests with Cousin Fritz.
It is a novel experience for me to suspend
my own judgment and trust to another man
to get me out of difficulties, but the little
madcap’s cleverness and loyalty have had a
hypnotic effect upon my will. More and more
do I find myself inclined to follow his lead,
to await his commands, and to trust to his ingenuity
to get us out of this amazing scrape.”</p>

<p>The Princess Hilda assented. “Cousin
Fritz,” she said, “has become, I fear, our
only hope. What he can do for us now I
can’t imagine, but, Herr Bennett, there is
some satisfaction in the thought that we can
never be worse off than we are at present.”</p>

<p>The American uttered a few words of perfunctory
acquiescence. He envied her the
undismayed optimism of extreme youth.
The conviction had come upon him that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
might easily be placed in a more undesirable
position than they occupied at that moment.</p>

<p>“Herr Bennett,” said the princess, a slight
flush of embarrassment coming into her
cheeks. “I was pleased to hear you speak
so kindly of Cousin Fritz, but let me urge
you to beware of the others. Cousin Fritz
is your friend. The others hate you.”</p>

<p>Bennett smiled gently. “Thank you for
your warning, Princess Hilda. I know well
that they seek my life. But I have no fear
of them. Some years ago, your royal highness,
I was mining in Colorado, and,——”</p>

<p>It was many a long day before the Princess
Hilda heard the conclusion of the anecdote
Bennett was about to relate. Something in
her face had caused him to turn and glance
toward the entrance. He caught a glimpse
of Cousin Fritz making a gesture toward
them, and then his eyes rested in dismay
upon the tall, martial figure of Carl Eingen.</p>

<p>“Good God, we are betrayed!” exclaimed
Bennett, stepping forward and placing his
hand upon the handle of his revolver.</p>

<p>At that instant a groan, wrung from a
strong man in physical agony, arose from
the centre of the room, and King Rudolph,
who had sprung up from the poker table as
Fritz and Carl appeared at the doorway, fell
senseless into the arms of Baron Wollenstein.</p>

<p>“Put up your pistol, Herr Bennett,” piped
Cousin Fritz, excitedly. “This man is our
friend. Here, put the king on this couch!
Get some wine, Fraulein Müller. Hurry.
Baron Wollenstein, put his head down!
There! Are you all paralyzed? Can’t you
make haste? Will you take a bluff from death?
I won’t. There, see! Cousin Rudolph opens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
his eyes! Give him wine! That’s right!
He’ll be every inch a king before long!
Come, now, stand back and let him sleep!
That’s right. Sleep, Rudolph! Sleep!”</p>

<p>Without dissent or hesitation they had all
obeyed the dwarf’s directions to the letter,
and as they stood grouped around the couch,
upon which Rudolph lay breathing stertorously,
the thought suddenly flashed through
their minds, in sympathetic accord for the
moment, that Cousin Fritz was no vain
boaster when he claimed to be the real ruler
of Hesse-Heilfels.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

</div>

<p>“Frankly, your royal highness,” said
Herr Bennett to the princess fifteen minutes
later, “there are symptoms in the case that
worry me. At first, I thought his majesty
was attacked by a simple fainting fit, caused
by his sudden rising at the table. His breathing,
however, and other indications lead me
to believe that he is in a very precarious condition.”</p>

<p>They stood together apart, while Fraulein
Müller and Carl Eingen, conversing in low
whispers, watched beside the prostrated king.</p>

<p>Count von Reibach and Baron Wollenstein,
not unnoticed by Cousin Fritz, had
left the apartment together.</p>

<p>“We must have a talk at once, Count,”
Wollenstein had said to his fellow-conspirator.
“Come into the cellars with me. We
won’t be missed at this moment.” Unknown
to them, the dwarf had stolen into the dark
vaults by their side so close to them that he
could hear every word they said.</p>

<p>“Is he hard hit, Baron?” asked Count von
Reibach. “It looks to me like apoplexy.”</p>

<p>“I think it is,” answered Wollenstein, taking
his companion by the arm and groping
toward a better lighted portion of the cellar
that lay beyond them. “He’s been a sick
man for some time back, Count. I’m inclined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
to think that the suddenness of his
overthrow has precipitated an attack that
could not have been long delayed.”</p>

<p>“And what, to your mind, is our best play
at this juncture, Baron?” asked von Reibach
impressively. The serious nature of the
crisis that confronted them had suddenly
broken upon his not very active mind. His
companion made no answer, but stood still,
his head turned to one side.</p>

<p>“The very thing,” whispered Wollenstein
hoarsely. “Read that, Count! How it got
here I can’t imagine, but it’s a wonderful
stroke of luck at this juncture.”</p>

<p>Count von Reibach followed his companion’s
gaze and saw before them a type-written
placard, the contents of which the reader has
already learned.</p>

<p>The count indulged in a weak whistle to
relieve his astonishment. “Dead or alive!”
he exclaimed. “It ought to be easy, Baron.
I could put the dwarf in my pocket—if I
could get my hands on him.”</p>

<p>Wollenstein grunted deprecatingly, “We
cannot afford to take any chances, Count,”
he said emphatically. “We are in a desperate
position. Our heads are forfeit to the
state unless we can take our fatted calf with
us when we go above as returning prodigals.
It’s all very well to talk about capturing the
dwarf alive, but you can’t catch rats in this
infernal cellar by chasing them. Our only
chance lies in seizing Cousin Fritz and rendering
all opportunity of escape impossible
at one stroke. It’s easily done. Let me get
hold of the little imp once and Wilhelm shall
have a court jester, dead or alive, as the case
may be.” There was a cruel menace in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
baron’s voice that was carefully noted by a
dwarfish eavesdropper.</p>

<p>“What was that?” asked the count, starting
nervously and gazing into the shadows with
straining eyes.</p>

<p>“Ach Gott! Are you scared by rats?”
muttered the baron sarcastically. “Now
come to the point, Count! Do you understand
me? We must act, and act immediately.
Our only hope lies in the capture of
the dwarf. We must set about it at once,
and take him—dead or alive.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dead or alive,” repeated Count von
Reibach mechanically, seizing his companion’s
arm and turning to retrace his steps.</p>

<p>There came a snapping sound, as though a
trap had been sprung somewhere in the darkness.
The floor slipped away in creaking
grooves and at the edge of the abyss stood
Cousin Fritz, smiling maliciously as he gazed
down into the blackness. A dull sound, as if
huge rubber balls had struck the centre of
the earth, came up through the grewsome
hole.</p>

<p>“Two of a kind!” cried the madman, in a
shrill, penetrating voice. “Two of a kind—and
I’ve discarded them!”</p>

<p>He whistled gayly as he scurried back toward
his apartments. Now and then he would
break into song and his keen voice would
startle the bats from slumber in the furthermost
recesses of the great vaults.</p>

<p>“Two of a kind! Two of a kind! Two of
a kind!” he cried with hysterical energy now
and again. “Two of a kind, but a very small
pair! Ha, ha! I had no use for two of a
kind, two of a kind, two of a kind!”</p>

<p>Suddenly he stood still and listened intently.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
“The King is dead, long live the
King!” he shouted, and the cellar re-echoed
the weird cry. “The King is dead! Live
the King!”</p>

<p>At that moment Bennett had placed a detaining
hand upon the Princess Hilda’s arm.
The cumulative force of the adventures
through which they had passed together had
rendered ceremoniousness out of place at
this juncture.</p>

<p>“The need of aid from above has passed,
your highness,” said Bennett gently. “I
beg you to remain here. The King is——”</p>

<p>“Is dead,” added the princess sadly.</p>

<p>At that instant far down the cellar they
heard the dwarf’s voice crying shrilly: “The
King is dead! Live the King!”</p>

<p>Bennett gazed at the princess in amazement.</p>

<p>“’Tis Cousin Fritz’s voice. But how did he
know? How did he know?”</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

</div>

<p>“Are you very tired, your highness?”</p>

<p>Bennett peered down at the pale face at
his side. He held a candle in his hand as
they groped slowly forward in a tunnel that
Cousin Fritz ascribed to the Romans. Beyond
them gleamed another unsteady light,
carried by Carl Eingen. Now and then they
could hear a penetrating voice raised in song
or lowered in soliloquy as Cousin Fritz
guided them toward their goal.</p>

<p>The Princess Hilda and Fraulein Müller
had laid aside their court attire and had
donned peasant costumes, of a very antique
cut, which Cousin Fritz had obtained from
his collection of old-fashioned trumpery, a
collection from which the social history of
Hesse-Heilfels for several generations could
have been reconstructed by an imaginative
writer.</p>

<p>The princess looked up at Bennett, a merry
gleam in her dark blue eyes:</p>

<p>“I’m tired, yes; but not of action. I am
weary of imprisonment. I long to reach the
end of this tunnel. I feel as though I were
approaching the sunlight after being buried
alive for centuries.”</p>

<p>“But, tell me,” he persisted, his voice low
and vibrant, “will you never regret your decision?
Think of what you have given up.
When you donned that peasant’s dress you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
laid aside a future that shone with the splendors
of high state. That simple cap upon
your head replaces a queen’s diadem. The
sacrifice, your highness, is more than I can
ask.”</p>

<p>“Why will you tease me?” she cried with
petulant playfulness. “When I put off my
court dress, I gave up forever the title of
‘your highness.’ What has that title brought
to me? Nothing but weariness and pain.”</p>

<p>Just beyond them she could see Carl Eingen
with his arm around the waist of Fraulein
Müller. “Do you think,” asked Hilda,
her eyes dancing as they met Bennett’s, “do
you think that Gretchen would wish to return
to my court with the knowledge that
Carl Eingen was forever an exile from the
kingdom?”</p>

<p>Bennett trembled with a sensation of
ecstatic triumph. His mind recalled the
thought that had inspired him when he followed
the Princess Hilda into the cellar on
the night of the king’s overthrow. In this
subterranean realm there would be no kings
and princesses. They would all be fugitives,
placed upon a plane of equality by the levelling
power of misfortune. Beyond his wildest
dreams, that thought had been prophetic.
By no conscious effort upon his part, he had
won the confidence, perhaps the love, of this
woman at his side. The hand of sorrow had
laid its grip upon her young heart, and in the
hour of her misfortune she had looked at life
with eyes that saw all things from a new
point of view.</p>

<p>“It is strange,” she whispered as they stole
forward through the damp and narrow passageway,
“it is strange that I should feel for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
my old life no regret, no desire to return to
the tawdry glories of a court. But do you
know, Herr Bennett, I feel that I would
rather die in this old cellar than go back to
my people, to be stared at by the gaping
crowds, to hear the murmur of their senseless
chatter as they told each other the tale
of my burial and resurrection. Ugh! The
very thought of it is horrible.”</p>

<p>They hurried on in silence for a time.</p>

<p>“I shall live with Carl and Gretchen,” she
said musingly, when they had turned a corner
in the tunnel and had again caught sight
of the candle in Eingen’s hand. “We will
go to some quiet spot and till the soil and
forget the treachery that drove us from our
fatherland. I shall be happy in their happiness—and
forget—forget—forget!”</p>

<p>Bennett bent down until his face almost
touched hers.</p>

<p>“You must not forget,” he whispered,
“that there lives a man whose only wish on
earth is to know that your heart is light, that
your eyes are bright with the joy of life, that
no shadows fall across your path.”</p>

<p>Suddenly through the tunnel came the
shrill voice of the dwarf, chanting mischievously
the refrain, “Two of a kind.” Then a
mocking laugh followed the words into the
echoing vaults far behind the fugitives.</p>

<p>The Princess Hilda shuddered, and placed
a light hand upon Bennett’s arm.</p>

<p>“Do you know what he did to them?” she
asked nervously.</p>

<p>“He won’t tell me,” answered Bennett;
“all that he will say is that they were ‘a
small pair’ and he ‘discarded’ them.”</p>

<p>Again the princess shuddered, and quickened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
her steps. Suddenly the candle carried
by Carl Eingen flickered vigorously, and almost
succumbed to a damp draught. The
princess glanced up at Bennett joyfully.</p>

<p>“Look at Carl’s candle,” she exclaimed.
“Do you know what that means, Herr Bennett?
We are near the entrance, or rather,
the exit to the tunnel. The Rhine, Herr
Bennett, the dear, old Rhine is waiting to
take us to its heart.”</p>

<p>Her voice trembled with excitement and
she stumbled as she darted ahead. By a quick
movement Bennett’s arm caught her as she
fell forward. Forgetful of everything but
his burning love, he held her pressed against
him as he rained passionate kisses upon her
lips and cheeks.</p>

<p>“I love you, Hilda, I love you! I love you!”
he whispered wildly. “You are my queen!
my queen! Do not tremble so! See, I will
be gentle! Just one more kiss, my darling!
One more kiss! One more kiss!”</p>

<p>“Two of a kind, two of a kind, two of a
kind,” cried a harsh voice, close at hand.
“There, Carl Eingen, is the river, and here’s
the boat! Pull it up close to the wall. That’s
right. Ha, ha! I must discard again! This
time it’s two pair! Two pair! Ha, ha!”</p>

<p>Carl Eingen had entered the flat-bottomed
boat and had placed the oars in the rowlocks,
after seating Fraulein Müller in the stern.</p>

<p>The Princess Hilda and Herr Bennett stood
upon the stone-work that jutted out from the
tunnel’s opening. The breeze that swept
across the bosom of the Rhine caressed their
cheeks and made free with Hilda’s golden
locks. Behind them stood Cousin Fritz, cap
in hand, as though he did the honors of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
mansion to home-going guests. Bennett gave
his hand to the princess and she seated herself
by Fraulein Müller’s side.</p>

<p>“Come, Cousin Fritz,” cried Bennett, his
voice vibrant with the joy that filled his soul,
“into the boat! Quick! We can afford to
take no risks—Wilhelm’s sentinel may have
sharp eyes. Quick, I say!”</p>

<p>Cousin Fritz stepped back into the tunnel.
His small, white wizened face became a
ghostly vision against the black depths behind
him.</p>

<p>“Farewell,” he cried in his thin, mocking
voice, “farewell! My kingdom needs its
king, and I return! Remember Cousin Fritz,
King of Hesse-Heilfels for a thousand years!
Farewell!”</p>

<p>Bennett pushed the boat into the current
and jumped aboard. With powerful strokes
Carl Eingen urged the clumsy craft toward
the centre of the stream. Suddenly across
the black waste of waters between them and
the shore came a piercing voice as they heard
the disjointed words:</p>

<p>“Two pair! Discard two pair! Draw to
kings! Ha, ha! Draw to kings! Ha, ha!”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.</h3>

</div>

<p>September in the Berkshire hills makes
Litchfield, Connecticut, an attractive place
to people of leisure who like to watch nature
as she doffs her summer garb of green and
yellow and dons the purple and scarlet raiment
that autumn provides for her.</p>

<p>Upon the broad piazza of a hotel commanding
a wide view of a hill country unrivalled for
beauty in the new world sat several men and
women indulging in the idle gossip that falls
from the lips of people who have nothing
more serious confronting them than a game
of golf or a drive through the woods.</p>

<p>“Anything interesting in the <cite>Trumpet</cite>,
Hal?” asked a youth, attired in a most unbecoming
golf costume, glancing at a young
man who held in his hands a copy of the
latest issue of Litchfield’s weekly newspaper.</p>

<p>“Calvin Johnson has put a new coat of
paint on his barn,” answered the news-reader
solemnly. “Mrs. Rogers spent Sunday with
friends in Roxbury.”</p>

<p>“Oh, stop it, Hal,” cried a vivacious young
woman, putting up her hand imperiously.
“You’ll drive us all away if you keep on.”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment! Let me read you something
of more interest,” said the young man
with the newspaper impressively. “This is
the <i lang="fr">pièce de résistance</i> of the week’s <cite>Trumpet</cite>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>“‘We take pleasure in informing our readers
that Jonathan Edwards Bennett, an old
resident of Litchfield, has returned from a
long sojourn in Europe and has reopened the
Bennett homestead on Main Street. Mr. Bennett
is accompanied by his wife. Rumor
has it that Mrs. Bennett is a daughter of one
of the oldest and most aristocratic families
in central Europe. Mr. and Mrs. Bennett are
entertaining their friends, Mr. and Mrs. Eingen,
of Germany, who will remain in Litchfield
until late in the fall. The <cite>Trumpet</cite> is
informed that Mr. Bennett will take up his
residence permanently in Litchfield. It is
understood that he will devote much time to
politics. We congratulate our fellow-townsmen
upon Mr. Bennett’s return to his native
heath and take pleasure in bidding him welcome.’”</p>


<p>“That explains it, then!” exclaimed the
vivacious young woman excitedly. “That
must have been Mrs. Bennett we saw yesterday,
Marion. She is really a beautiful woman,
with magnificent golden hair and the
dearest blue eyes! She’s a perfect love!
Isn’t she, Marion?”</p>

<p>“She is, indeed,” answered the girl appealed
to.</p>

<p>“Jonathan Edwards Bennett,” repeated
one of the men who had listened to the
<cite>Trumpet’s</cite> choice tid-bit. “He was in my
class at Yale. A clever fellow, but restless.
They used to say of him that he would be
famous or a failure before he had been out
in the world five years.”</p>

<p>“And has he been a success?” drawled the
youth in the golf suit.</p>

<p>“Of course he has,” cried the vivacious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
young woman, “hasn’t he married a beautiful
girl with golden hair and blue eyes? Surely,
he could ask nothing better of life than that.”</p>

<p>Could Jonathan Edwards Bennett have
heard these words he would have acknowledged
that the vivacious young woman spoke
the truth.</p>
